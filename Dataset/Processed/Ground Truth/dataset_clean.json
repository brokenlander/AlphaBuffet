Second, it must conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does. Third, it should set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered. And fourth, it must be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can't be obtained. It's like a good poker player knowing when to fold 'em."
