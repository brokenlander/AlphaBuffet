Look, when a company reports a new high in earnings per share, you need to consider that most businesses naturally add to their equity base year after year. So if you see a company with, say, a 10% larger equity base producing only a 5% bump in earnings per share, that's really nothing to write home about. Let me give you a simple example that I think makes this clear - consider a basic savings account. It will show steadily rising interest earnings each year just from compounding, even though it's completely passive with no management involved at all. That's why I believe return on equity capital is generally a much better yardstick for measuring how well management is actually performing. It tells you what they're doing with the capital they have, not just whether a larger pile of money is generating more dollars in absolute terms."

We include capital gains from Blue Chip Stamps in our operating earnings, but only to the extent of our proportional interest in that company. In 1977, for instance, this added $1.43 per share to our operating earnings of $22.54. However - and this is an important distinction - we do not include capital gains or losses realized directly by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. or its insurance subsidiaries in our operating earnings calculations. Now, while I caution against putting too much weight on any single year's figures, I should emphasize that the long-term record of aggregate capital gains or losses is obviously significant to our overall performance. This is part of our commitment to providing a clear picture of our business performance, while recognizing that different types of gains may have different implications for understanding our operations."

        "value": "Well, one of the most important lessons I've learned - and sometimes had to relearn, I might add - is the critical importance of being in businesses where tailwinds prevail rather than headwinds. Let me give you a concrete example from our own experience. In our insurance operations, we can make some significant mistakes - and we certainly have made our share, including problems with our surety operation and that Worker's Compensation situation in California - yet still achieve quite satisfactory overall performance. That's a tailwind business. Now contrast that with our textile business, where even very good management probably can average only modest results. That's a headwind business. You see, in insurance, when we make mistakes, the fundamental economics of the business still work in our favor. The key is being in an industry where the wind is at your back. It's like choosing to run a race either with the wind helping you along or fighting against it the whole way. Why make things harder than they need to be? I'd much rather be smart about picking the race than be the fastest runner in a headwind."

        "value": "The insurance industry has a very interesting pricing dynamic that you need to understand. Let me break it down. First, we face what I estimate to be about a 1% monthly cost increase in our insurance operations. This comes from two types of inflation: there's the regular monetary inflation that affects repair costs for both property and medical expenses, and then there's what I call 'social inflation' - that's where society and juries keep broadening their interpretation of what insurance policies should cover. Now, here's the tricky part - and this is crucial to understand - insurance policies typically run for one-year periods, and we can only correct our pricing mistakes upon renewal. We saw this play out in 1976-77. The industry implemented very large rate increases in 1976 to make up for the terrible underwriting results of 1974 and 1975. But because of this one-year policy structure, it wasn't until 1977 that we saw the full earnings impact of those rate increases. It's like steering a large ship - there's a significant lag between when you turn the wheel and when the ship actually changes course. Right now, we're seeing the pendulum swing back the other way. That's the nature of the insurance business - you need to price for inflation while dealing with this inherent lag in the system."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, what we're seeing is costs in our insurance operations rising at about 1% per month, and there are two main factors behind this. First, you've got the basic monetary inflation that affects repair costs - whether we're fixing cars, buildings, or helping people recover from injuries. But there's also what we call 'social inflation.' This is where society and juries keep broadening their interpretation of what insurance policies should cover. Now, here's the key point - unless insurance rates can keep pace with that 1% monthly cost increase, your underwriting profits are going to shrink. It's just simple mathematics. Recently, we've noticed rate increases slowing down significantly, and I expect we'll see underwriting margins declining in the second half of the year. It's like running up an escalator that's going down - if you slow down your pace, you're going to lose ground. That's why we need to be particularly vigilant about pricing adequacy and be willing to accept lower volume rather than chase business at foolish prices."

We've seen this cycle play out at National Indemnity - we had excellent underwriting margins when many competitors pulled back after the 1974-75 crisis, which gave us both strong profitability and substantial funds for investment. But markets inevitably loosen up, and rates become inadequate. That's when we face what I consider our real test - having the discipline to accept reduced volume rather than chase bad business. It runs completely counter to normal institutional behavior to let competitors take business away, even when they're pricing it foolishly. But that's exactly what we must do. It requires unusual managerial discipline to stick to our principles when everyone else is being aggressive. We've seen this work well under Phil Liesche's leadership, with great support from Roland Miller in Underwriting and Bill Lyons in Claims. They've achieved extraordinary underwriting results by maintaining this discipline. But make no mistake - it's not easy to stand firm when others are writing business at inadequate rates. You have to be willing to watch business walk away when prices don't make sense."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, insurance is quite unique because it really strips away all the traditional competitive advantages you might see in other industries. Let me explain why. In insurance, we're essentially selling standardized policies that anyone can copy. There's no special sauce here - we're just making promises. You don't need fancy patents or trademarks. Location doesn't matter much. It doesn't even matter if you've been around for 100 years or 1 year. The barriers to entry are actually quite low - getting licensed isn't particularly difficult, and our pricing is basically an open book that anyone can see. What's interesting is that you can't differentiate yourself through traditional means like having better raw materials or a prime retail location. Customers don't typically develop brand loyalty like they might with Coca-Cola or See's Candies. This makes insurance a pure commodity in many ways, which is why the quality of management becomes absolutely crucial. That's why I'm so pleased with our managers like Jim Stodolka at Lakeland and Milt Thornton at Cypress - they're the real differentiators in this business."

        "value": "You know, it's interesting - you often see companies talk about how important their people are in their annual reports, and sometimes it's true, sometimes it's just nice-sounding words. But in insurance, it's absolutely fundamental. Let me tell you why. Since we're selling promises and standardized policies, with rates that are publicly available and no real product differentiation, the performance of the company comes down almost entirely to the judgment and capability of the managers making the decisions. That's why I'm so particular about our management team. Take someone like Milt Thornton at Cypress - he's been running a first-class operation since 1968 that works well for everyone involved: policyholders, agents, employees, and owners. Or look at Jim Stodolka at Lakeland Fire and Casualty - his team achieved the lowest loss ratio among our homestate companies. The nature of insurance truly magnifies the impact that individual managers have on company performance. There's nowhere to hide poor management decisions behind fancy products or protected markets. That's why we're incredibly fortunate to have the group of managers we do - they're the real secret to our success in this business."

Look, we had an unrealized loss of $17 million at the end of 1974, and then by the end of 1977, we were sitting on about $74 million in unrealized gains. But you know what? Neither of those numbers meant much to us. Here's why: most of our large stock positions are investments we plan to hold for many years. The real scorecard - the only one that matters - comes from the underlying business results over that extended period. It's just like buying an entire company. You wouldn't focus solely on next quarter's earnings when buying a whole business, would you? So why would you do that when buying small pieces of a business through the stock market? Getting mesmerized by near-term earnings or recent trends is just as unsound when you're buying marketable securities as it would be when acquiring an entire company. That's a fundamental principle we stick to at Berkshire."

Let me give you the numbers: our insurance investments grew from $134.6 million to $252.8 million over just two years. This dramatic growth comes from two sources - first, the insurance reserves we get from our increasing premium volume, and second, our retained earnings. The beautiful thing about this is how it flows to the bottom line - our net investment income in the insurance group went from $8.4 million pre-tax in 1975 to $12.3 million pre-tax in 1977. And that's just the investment income from dividends and interest. We also realized capital gains of $6.9 million before tax, with about a quarter coming from bonds and the rest from stocks. But what's really crucial to understand is the role of our managers here. The nature of the insurance business magnifies the effect that individual managers have on company performance. We're incredibly fortunate to have the group of managers that are associated with us. They're the ones who help generate these insurance reserves that we can then invest productively."

Look at Berkshire Hathaway itself - in 1948, the combined companies that would become Berkshire had earnings of $18 million and 10,000 employees. They were what you'd call an economic powerhouse at the time, with earnings that compared favorably to companies like IBM, Safeway, and Time Inc. But what happened next? In the decade after the 1955 merger, despite having sales of $595 million, Berkshire actually lost $10 million. The company's net worth dropped from $53 million to just $22 million by 1964. So you see, that single-year snapshot from 1948 told you absolutely nothing about the real prospects of the business. It's just as foolish to get mesmerized by near-term earnings or recent trends when buying stocks as it would be when acquiring an entire company. You've got to look deeper and longer-term than that."

In 1948, we looked like a genuine powerhouse - $18 million in earnings, 10,000 employees, a dozen mills across New England. To put that in perspective, that was more than half of what IBM earned that year, and significantly more than companies like Safeway at $10 million or Time Inc. at $9 million. But those numbers were essentially meaningless as predictors of future performance. Within a decade after the 1955 merger of Berkshire Fine Spinning and Hathaway Manufacturing, we had aggregate losses of $10 million on $595 million in sales. We went from twelve mills down to just two, and our net worth collapsed from $53 million to $22 million. That's why I always emphasize looking at the fundamental strength of a business rather than getting caught up in any single year's performance numbers. The textile operation's decline shows how dramatically a business can change even when starting from what appears to be a position of significant strength."

There are four key things we demand: First, we have to understand the business. I won't invest in anything I can't understand - that's just common sense. Second, we want favorable long-term prospects. We're not interested in businesses that look good for just a quarter or two. Third, and this is absolutely crucial, we need honest and competent people running the show. Finally, the price has to be very attractive. You know, we often find that pieces of wonderful businesses sell in the securities markets at huge discounts compared to what you'd have to pay to buy the whole company.

When we buy these positions, we're not thinking about next quarter's stock price. We're thinking about the long-term business prospects. Notice how we have substantial positions in each of these companies. When we find a business we like, operated by people we trust, selling at an attractive price, we're willing to take a meaningful position. You can see this particularly with our GEICO investment, where we own both common stock and convertible preferred shares. The market value of many of these holdings is substantially above our cost basis, but that's not because we were trying to time the market. It's because we bought good businesses at good prices and let time work in our favor.

When we find truly outstanding businesses that continue to satisfy our criteria, lower market prices are actually an opportunity - they let us acquire more of a good thing at a better price. You see, what we've found over the years is that the stock market sometimes offers pro-rata portions of exceptional businesses at substantial discounts compared to what you'd pay if you were buying the entire company outright. Now, we're not looking to take control or hoping for a quick merger when we make these purchases. What we're really doing is making a long-term bet that excellent business results will eventually translate into excellent market value and dividend results for owners, whether they're minority or majority shareholders. Think about our Capital Cities investment - we put in $10.9 million in 1977. To buy those properties directly would have cost us about twice as much, with no real advantages. So when we see these opportunities in the market, we're perfectly happy to take very large positions and wait for the business performance to drive long-term returns."

When we invested $10.9 million in Capital Cities in 1977, the actual earnings attributable to our shares were about $1.3 million. But if you looked at our operating earnings, you'd only see the $40,000 in annual cash dividends we received. That's quite a difference! The key here is understanding that the reported earnings impact can be negligible even when you're buying into an extraordinary business. Capital Cities is exactly that - a company with both extraordinary properties and extraordinary management, with skills in both operations and capital allocation. This is why we're willing to look past initial earnings impact when we find these rare businesses selling at attractive prices in the stock market. We're focused on the underlying business quality and long-term economics, not just what shows up in our immediate operating results. The market sometimes gives us these opportunities to buy partial interests in great businesses at prices far below what we'd have to pay to own them outright."
