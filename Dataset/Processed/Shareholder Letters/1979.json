        "value": "Well, I believe measuring operating performance against equity with securities at market value can really distort the picture. Let me explain why. When you use market values, you're introducing a lot of noise into the equation because of those wide year-to-year swings in market prices. Think about it this way - if there's a big decline in securities values, you end up with a very low market value net worth. That can make even mediocre operating earnings look artificially good. And it works the other way too - when your equity investments have done really well, your net worth base gets larger, which makes your operating performance look worse than it really is. That's why we stick to measuring against beginning net worth with securities at cost. It gives us a much clearer picture of how we're actually performing in our operations. You want your measuring stick to be stable, not one that's bouncing around based on market movements that have nothing to do with how well you're running the business."

Take a dormant savings account or a U.S. Savings Bond with a fixed interest rate. The earnings per share will keep rising year after year simply because you're plowing back the earnings - the interest - and adding it to your capital base. But that doesn't mean you're performing better! In our case, we had about a 20% increase in earnings per share in 1979, but I actually consider that we performed worse than in 1978. Why? Because we had substantially more capital to work with in 1979, and our performance in utilizing that capital wasn't as good as the previous year, even though the per-share earnings went up. That's why we focus on operating earnings as a percentage of beginning net worth - it tells us how well we're actually doing with the capital we have to work with."

You see, EPS will naturally rise even in a completely dormant investment, like a savings account or U.S. Savings Bond, simply because you're plowing back the interest and adding it to your capital base. It's like having a stopped clock that somehow looks like it's moving forward. The real test - and I want to emphasize this - is whether management achieves a high earnings rate on equity capital employed, without resorting to excessive leverage or accounting tricks. This is fundamentally different from just showing consistent EPS growth. I believe both shareholders and the general public would have a much better understanding of businesses if we shifted away from this fixation on earnings per share and its year-to-year changes. Think of it this way: a business earning a high return on equity is like a machine that efficiently turns capital into profits. That's what we should be measuring, not just whether the total dollars of earnings went up because you retained and reinvested last year's earnings."

Here's why: these capital gains or losses, whether they're realized or still on paper, are just as important to shareholders over a period of years as the earnings that come through regular operations. The catch is that they can be extremely unpredictable in the short term, which is precisely why they're not a good yardstick for measuring how management performed in any single year. It's like trying to judge a farmer's ability by looking at one season's crop during a year of extreme weather - it just doesn't tell you the whole story.

Now, you're absolutely right that they can be incredibly capricious in the short term - that's why we don't use them to judge how management did in any single year. It would be like judging a baseball player's ability based on one at-bat. But over time, these gains or losses become a crucial part of the total picture. Look at our own results - our book value grew at 20.5% compounded annually from 1964 to 1979, which is way above what you'd calculate just looking at yearly operating earnings. That difference comes largely from capital appreciation in our insurance equity investments. So while these gains might bounce around like a yo-yo in the short term, they're absolutely vital to include when you're measuring long-term economic performance."

We've done this while maintaining a consistently low amount of leverage - both in terms of debt to equity and in our insurance business's premium volume to capital funds ratio. We haven't played games with issuing or buying back shares either. It's worth noting that our starting point in 1964 might have actually overstated what the company was really worth - the assets weren't quite worth 100 cents on the dollar back then, though the liabilities were solid. So when you look at that 20.5% compound annual growth rate, it's come from fundamental business performance and smart capital allocation, particularly in our insurance equity investments, rather than financial engineering or excessive risk-taking. We've essentially taken a conservative approach to achieve what might look like aggressive results."

What's interesting is that we've done this primarily by working with our initial capital base, without playing games with share issuances or buybacks. Our growth has come through two main channels: we've bought thirteen businesses through negotiated cash purchases from private owners, and we've started six others from scratch. And I want to emphasize something that's particularly gratifying - the sellers who've dealt with us have been, almost without exception, extraordinarily honorable and fair, both during the sales and afterward.

Let me be clear - even a business showing impressive numbers, say compounding at 20% annually in per-share net worth, might not be delivering real value to its owners in an inflationary environment. The math is actually quite sobering. Think about those old 3% savings bonds, or 5% passbook savings accounts, or even 8% Treasury Notes. Inflation has transformed all of these from wealth-building instruments into wealth-destroying ones over their investment lives. The same principle applies to businesses. A company earning 20% on capital - which sounds fantastic - can actually produce a negative real return for its owners if inflation gets too high. The ultimate determinant of whether our internal operating performance translates into real investment success - and by that I mean actual gains in purchasing power from the money you've committed - comes down to two factors: the inflation rate and individual tax rates. We're seeing this play out right now under current inflationary conditions. It's a bit like running up a down escalator - you need to run faster and faster just to stay in place."

Let me explain it this way: When you combine the inflation rate with the taxes an owner must pay to actually get their hands on the earnings - whether through dividends or capital gains - you get what I call the 'investor's misery index.' Here's the really important part: if this index exceeds what a business earns on equity, you're actually losing purchasing power even if you don't spend a dime. Think about those old 3% savings bonds, or 5% passbook accounts, or even 8% Treasury Notes. They all seemed like decent investments at one point, but inflation transformed them into instruments that destroy purchasing power rather than build it. Even a business earning a seemingly impressive 20% on capital - which is quite good - can generate negative real returns for owners under significant inflation. The math is pretty straightforward but often overlooked. You've got to earn more than the combination of inflation plus the tax bite just to stay even in terms of real purchasing power."

Even if we manage to achieve a 20% compounded gain at Berkshire - and I should emphasize that's not easy or guaranteed by any means - the real return to shareholders could effectively be zero in a high-inflation environment. Here's how: With a 14% inflation rate, most of that nominal 20% gain is already eaten away just by inflation. Then, of the remaining six percentage points, most of that goes to Uncle Sam whenever you want to actually realize those gains - whether through taxes on dividends or capital gains taxes when you sell shares. So even though you might see a 20% gain on paper, and even though that might translate into a corresponding increase in Berkshire's stock price as it has historically done, your actual purchasing power gain after taxes could be very close to zero. It's like running up a down escalator - you're moving your legs a lot, but not really getting anywhere in terms of real wealth creation. This is why we have to be so focused not just on nominal returns, but on real, after-tax returns in terms of purchasing power."

What we're looking at is a double whammy - you've got inflation eating away at value on one side, and then you've got the government taking its bite through taxes when you try to get your earnings, whether through dividends or capital gains. When you add these two factors together, that's your misery index. Now, here's the really troubling part - when this index exceeds what your business is actually earning on equity, you're losing purchasing power even if you don't spend a dime of your money. And I have to be straight with you - we at Berkshire don't have some magic corporate solution to this problem. High inflation isn't going to help us earn higher returns on equity. It's just a fact we have to deal with. The government has gotten remarkably good at printing money and making promises, but as I've observed, they can't print gold or create oil. That's why we focus on what we can control - managing our internal business affairs as effectively as possible."

If you look at our book value at the end of 1964, it would have bought you about half an ounce of gold. Now, fast forward fifteen years - after we've reinvested all our earnings and put in tremendous effort (what I call the blood, sweat, and tears), that book value still only buys about the same half ounce of gold. You could make the same comparison with Middle Eastern oil. This really drives home a crucial point about real returns versus nominal returns. While we've grown significantly in dollar terms, the actual purchasing power hasn't kept pace in terms of certain hard assets. This isn't just about Berkshire - it's about the broader environment we operate in. The external conditions, particularly those affecting currency stability, may end up being the most important factor in determining whether shareholders see any real rewards from their Berkshire investment. That's why I believe it's critical for investors to understand that managing a business well is only part of the equation - the monetary environment can have an enormous impact on real returns."

Now, these businesses typically sell at premium prices - what I call a thousand cents on the dollar - but they might still be the better route to go. We found this out through our experience in textiles, particularly with Waumbec Mills. You see, we bought that business at what seemed like an extraordinary bargain statistically. We got it for less than working capital, essentially getting machinery and real estate for less than nothing. But it was still a mistake. The underlying economics of the industry were just too tough. Compare that to someone like Ben Rosner at Associated Retail Stores, who keeps producing large earnings relative to capital in a supposedly unexciting market. The key difference is the fundamental economics of the business, not just the purchase price. Sometimes paying up for an 'easy' business with great underlying economics is smarter than getting a 'bargain' in a difficult one."

You can have the best swimmer in the world, but if you put them in a pool with concrete blocks tied to their feet, they're not going to win any races. That's what it's like trying to overcome tough industry economics. The textile business taught us that even with skilled management, you can't overcome the fundamental characteristics of a challenging industry. When you find managers like Ben Rosner who can produce large earnings in cash - not just paper profits tied up in receivables and inventory - and do it in an unexciting market, that's special.

But here's the key lesson: it was still a mistake. What we've learned, both through our operating and investment experience, is that your energies and talent are much better employed in a good business purchased at a fair price than in a poor business purchased at a bargain price. It's like trying to fix a leaky boat - as we found at Waumbec, new problems kept arising as fast as we could fix the old ones.

It's like everyone claims they'll eat their vegetables, but when dinner comes, they reach for the dessert instead. We take a different approach.

When you look at their $8.4 million underwriting profit on $82 million of earned premiums, you're seeing numbers that only a handful of companies in the entire industry could match. Now, looking forward to 1980, we expect the industry's performance to worsen by at least another few points. However, we're not expecting our relative performance advantage to increase further - though I should add we certainly won't hold back just to make that forecast come true! The key here is consistent discipline in underwriting. Phil maintains the strict standards that Jack Ringwalt established when founding the company.

Sure, insurance managers will tell you it's foolish to underwrite at a loss just to get investment income, but we believe many will do exactly that. What we're seeing is essentially a new normal developing - a higher tolerance for underwriting losses. Looking ahead, we expect the industry's combined ratio to average around 105 over the next five years. Now, some temporary factors have masked how bad things really are. The reduction in auto accidents due to changed driving habits from high gas prices has been a lucky break for the industry. But that won't last forever.

So while I expect us to do well over a period of years, I should warn you that the business can produce some truly terrible results in any single year. For instance, if auto accident frequency were to suddenly turn around, we'd likely have one of those tough years, just like everyone else in the industry."

Now, why am I comfortable with these companies keeping our earnings? Because we have faith in these managements - we believe they'll use those retained earnings effectively. Our expectation is that they'll translate each dollar retained into at least a dollar or more of subsequent market value for us. That's really what it's all about - having confidence in the ability of these management teams to reinvest profits effectively.

When you don't have to recognize market values, you might not pay attention to the real risks until it's too late. What's particularly interesting - and I might say concerning - is how these same companies handle their insurance policies. They've decided that one-year auto policies are too risky in an inflationary environment, switching to six-month policies because they can't predict costs like hospital expenses and auto parts prices for a full year. But then - and here's the real irony - they take the money from those six-month policies and commit it at fixed rates for 30 or 40 years in bonds. It's a remarkable contradiction in their risk assessment approach. They're essentially saying they can't predict costs twelve months ahead, but they're willing to lock in rates for decades. That's not what I would call sound business judgment."

Think about it - you can't get a fixed price for more than six months on auto insurance, medical services, newsprint, or office space. Anyone asking for a fixed price through 1985 on these would be laughed out of the room. But somehow, we've maintained this practice of very long-term bond contracts with fixed prices in an inflation-prone world. It's what I'd call a cultural lag in the bond market. The borrowers and underwriters aren't going to question it - why would they? And the lenders have simply slept through what I'd describe as an economic and contractual revolution. That's why at our insurance companies, we've stopped being net purchasers of straight long-term bonds. We might do some buying and selling, but overall, we're not increasing our exposure to these fixed-rate instruments."

The market has recognized this reality everywhere except in the bond market. What's particularly interesting is that this isn't some minor oversight - it's a fundamental shift in how business is conducted. In almost all other areas, long-term contracts have evolved to protect both parties from the effects of inflation. But in the bond market, we've continued with this practice of locking in prices for extremely long periods - thirty or forty years in many cases. It's as if the bond market is operating in a different era, stuck in a time when inflation wasn't a major concern. That's why I say there's been a cultural lag in the bond area.

Looking back, we made two significant mistakes. First, we shouldn't have bought 15-year bonds at all. Second, and more seriously, we should have sold them, even at a loss, when our views about inflation and interest rates began to crystallize. Now, I'll admit that these views are much clearer in hindsight - and you'd be right to ask why we weren't writing about this last year. But that's how we learn and adapt in this business."

Here's why that's important: we believe the conversion options we get effectively give that portion of our bond portfolio a much shorter average life than you'd think just looking at the maturity dates. The key advantage is flexibility - at a time of our choosing, we can terminate the bond contract by converting into stock. This gives us much better protection against inflation and interest rate risks compared to straight bonds. It's like having an escape hatch that we can use when conditions warrant. This approach aligns better with our current views on fixed dollar investments while still meeting our insurance operations' needs."

In recent years, we've limited ourselves primarily to convertible bonds because they give us more flexibility - we can convert to stock at a time of our choosing, effectively giving us a shorter average life than the stated maturity. Looking back at our experience, including our textile days, we should have recognized that trying to be too clever with sinking funds and special issues when the fundamental tide is running against you is futile. While our approach has given us lower unrealized losses than most property and casualty insurers, I actually believe our mistakes should be judged more harshly because we saw the problems developing and still participated.

This approach has given us significant advantages - particularly the conversion options that allow us to effectively manage the average life of our bond portfolio. The results speak for themselves: we've experienced significantly lower unrealized losses than the great majority of property and casualty insurance companies. But let me be candid here - while we've done better than most, we're still taking our lumps in bonds. The key difference is that we made our moves with our eyes wide open to the developing problems in the fixed-income market. That's actually why I feel we should be judged more strictly than others who simply followed conventional wisdom without recognizing the risks. It's like our experience in textiles - sometimes being clever in a fundamentally challenging market isn't enough.

That's essentially what you're doing with long-term bonds. Now, we do hold some fifteen-year bonds, and I'll be frank - that may turn out to be a mistake we'll pay for annually in terms of earning power. We've found some convertible bonds that look quite attractive, and we're hoping profits there might offset losses in straight bonds. But here's the thing - while current interest rates do factor in higher inflation projections than we saw a year or two ago, and they might prove adequate or even more than adequate for bond buyers, we're still not comfortable with that long-term commitment to paper currency. Could we be too negative in our analysis? Sure. The chances for very low inflation aren't zero - inflation is man-made, so perhaps it can be man-mastered.

But let me be clear about something - we're not jumping into these investments blindly. Just like with any investment, we're looking at the underlying fundamentals. The key advantage of convertible bonds in this environment is that they give us some protection against the structural weaknesses we're seeing in paper currencies, which is one of our main concerns with traditional long-term bonds. That said, we have to acknowledge that our current analysis could be overly negative. There's always the possibility that inflation could be brought under control - after all, it's a man-made problem. And we might even miss out on significant profits if there's a major rebound in bond prices.

Now, sure, we have to be thoughtful about competitive information and such, but the general scope, balance, and level of candor should be similar whether you're dealing with a public or private company.
