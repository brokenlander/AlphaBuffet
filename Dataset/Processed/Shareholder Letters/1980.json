Under conventional accounting, we only report the dividends we receive from that company - not our share of their total earnings. So if they pay out all earnings as dividends, we'd report $1 million. If they pay half, we'd report $500,000. And if they reinvest everything, we'd report zero. Now, here's the fascinating part - many of our partially-owned companies retain most of their earnings rather than paying them out as dividends. This means our reported earnings are showing only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, last year, the earnings these companies retained - earnings that belong to us proportionally but don't show up in our accounting - actually exceeded Berkshire's total reported operating earnings. So when you look at our reported earnings, you're seeing less than half of our true economic earnings. It's like having an iceberg where the bigger part is hidden underwater. The accounting doesn't capture the full reality of our economic position."

Second, the securities markets have presented particularly attractive opportunities in common stocks. This concentration in partially-owned companies, especially in the insurance field, is quite deliberate. While it might look inefficient from an accounting standpoint since we only report the dividends we receive, what really matters to us is the underlying earnings power of these companies, not their dividend payout. Remember, our economic well-being is determined by their earnings, not their dividends. We're perfectly happy to have these companies reinvest their earnings if they can do so productively, even though it means our reported earnings don't reflect their full contribution to Berkshire's value. This approach might make our accounting statements less straightforward, but it's consistent with our focus on long-term economic value rather than reported numbers."

        "value": "Well, this is a really important point that often gets misunderstood. You see, conventional accounting only shows you part of the picture - less than half of our earnings 'iceberg' appears above the surface. Let me be clear: the value of retained earnings to Berkshire isn't determined by whether we own 100%, 50%, 20% or 1% of a business. What really matters is the economic reality of what those retained earnings can do. I've seen cases where we owned 100% of businesses where the reported earnings weren't worth anywhere near 100 cents on the dollar to us. The accounting control was theoretical because we had to keep reinvesting just to maintain the existing assets, and those reinvested earnings couldn't generate market-rate returns. On the flip hand, we've owned small portions of businesses where their retained earnings were worth far more than 100 cents on the dollar because they had extraordinary reinvestment opportunities. That's why our analysis of earnings reality often differs from GAAP accounting, especially in times of high inflation. The accounting rules aren't perfect - and believe me, it's easier to criticize them than to improve them - but we have to look beyond them to understand true economic value."

Here's what's going on: we have large holdings in partially-owned companies that are growing their earnings nicely. When you look at the portion of 'our' earnings that these companies retained last year - meaning the earnings they kept rather than paid out as dividends - that amount was actually bigger than Berkshire Hathaway's total reported annual operating earnings. This is rare in the corporate world. Think about that - the earnings that don't even show up in our conventional accounting statements are larger than the earnings that do show up. It's like having an iceberg where the underwater part is bigger than what you can see above the surface. This happens because of two factors: first, the sheer size of our holdings in these companies has increased, and second, these partially-owned companies have been growing their earnings. The conventional accounting only lets you see the dividends we receive, not our share of all the earnings being reinvested for future growth. That's why you need to look beyond the surface numbers to understand the full earnings power of our investments."

What really matters is how those earnings are put to use and what kind of subsequent earnings they produce. Let me give you an example we mention in our letters - think about a tree growing in a forest where we own part of the land. Just because we might not record that growth in our financial statements doesn't mean we don't own our share of that tree. It's really quite simple - we'd rather have earnings being put to good use in a 10%-owned company by management we didn't hire than have earnings we control being put into questionable projects, even if we're the ones making those decisions. The accounting treatment is irrelevant. Our view is admittedly unconventional, but we focus on the economic reality rather than the accounting presentation. It's the act that counts, not the actors."

The reasoning behind this is remarkably simple: when you find a fine business selling in the marketplace for far less than its intrinsic value, what better use of capital could there be than enlarging the interests of all owners at that bargain price? It's really a straightforward proposition. When a company we've invested in uses their retained earnings this way, it's particularly attractive because it's increasing our ownership stake in a business we already believe in, and doing so at an advantageous price. This is exactly the kind of capital allocation decision we like to see - it's logical, it benefits all shareholders equally, and when done at the right price, it's one of the most certain and profitable ways a company can deploy its capital."

When you find a wonderful business selling in the marketplace for significantly less than its intrinsic value, having that company buy back its shares is about the surest and most profitable use of capital you can find. Let me explain why. When companies go out to acquire entire other businesses, they're typically in a competitive bidding situation. That competition almost guarantees they'll pay full price - and quite frequently more than full price. But here's the beautiful thing about stock markets: their auction nature often creates opportunities for well-run companies to buy portions of their own business at prices that can be under 50% of what they'd have to pay to get the same earning power by acquiring another company. Think about that - same earning power at half the price. It's like being able to buy a dollar bill for 50 cents. When you can enlarge the ownership interest of all remaining shareholders at such a bargain price, that's the kind of thing that gets me really enthusiastic. It's simple arithmetic, but it's amazing how many companies miss this opportunity or instead choose to pay full price for acquisitions."

But - and this is important - this translation process isn't smooth or predictable. You can't expect it to happen on a precise dollar-for-dollar basis, and the timing can be very uneven. In fact, in some years, it goes completely in reverse. This is why we focus on operating earnings compared to shareholders' equity for single-year performance, with securities valued at cost. But for our long-term yardstick, we include all capital gains or losses, whether they're realized or unrealized. It's like planting a tree - you know it will grow over time, but you can't predict exactly how tall it will be next spring, and some seasons might even see it lose a few branches. The key is understanding that while the market may not recognize the value of retained earnings immediately, over the long term, good businesses that retain and reinvest earnings productively tend to see those earnings reflected in market value."

Let me be clear - this translation process is highly uneven. Some years it works in reverse, and you certainly can't predict the timing. You're not going to see a precise dollar-for-dollar relationship either. I should emphasize something really important here: if you pay a foolish price for the stock to begin with, you can completely wipe out the benefits of ten years' worth of retained earnings. But - and this is crucial - when you make your initial purchase at sensible prices, the market will almost certainly recognize those accumulated retained earnings over the long term. Sometimes you get lucky and the market gives you some extra frosting on the cake, with appreciation that far exceeds what the company has retained since you bought in. That's why we continue to invest substantial sums through our insurance operations in well-run, favorably-situated companies, even when they pay out only small portions of their earnings as dividends."

In fact, the list of our errors is so long and painful that I'd rather not detail them all. But this teaches us a valuable lesson - you don't need to be perfect to achieve good results in business and investing. Think of it like baseball: you can still win games even if you strike out sometimes. What matters is maintaining a reasonably competitive batting average. The key is to make sensible decisions on your purchases, stay focused on well-run businesses, and maintain a long-term perspective. When you do that, even with some strikeouts along the way, the retained earnings and business fundamentals of good companies will typically work in your favor over time.

        "value": "Let me explain this with a simple hamburger example I like to use. Real earnings only exist when you gain actual purchasing power. Say you give up 10 hamburgers to make an investment. Then you get dividends that, after paying taxes, let you buy 2 hamburgers. Finally, when you sell the investment, after taxes you can buy 8 hamburgers. In this case, despite what the dollar figures might show, you've had no real income - you're still at 10 hamburgers. You started with the ability to buy 10 and ended with the ability to buy 10. You might feel wealthier because the dollar numbers are bigger, but you won't eat any better. This is why corporate reported earnings aren't the dominant variable anymore for determining real owner earnings. High inflation creates what I call a tax on capital. It raises the hurdle rate - the return on equity a business must achieve to generate any real return for its owners. Many corporate investments that look good on paper become unwise when measured against this reality of purchasing power. The numbers might look impressive in financial statements, but what matters is what those dollars can actually buy for the owner."

Now, we could easily switch to long-term tax-free bonds and immediately increase our reported operating earnings by over $30 million annually. But that tempts us not at all. Why? Because we expect our long-term returns from our current strategy to substantially exceed what we'd get from just focusing on reported operating earnings. You see, we've learned that you can achieve a reasonably competitive corporate batting average despite having some managerial strikeouts along the way. What matters isn't maximizing the earnings that show up in financial statements - it's maximizing real returns over the long term. We're focused on actual value creation, not reported numbers.

What we're seeing is that inflation creates what I call a 'tax on capital' that's particularly insidious because it's not immediately visible on your tax return. Let me give you a concrete example that illustrates this perfectly: Consider a business earning 20% on equity - which, by the way, is quite exceptional and very few companies achieve this consistently. Now, in an environment with 12% inflation, if this business distributes all earnings to shareholders in the 50% tax bracket, here's what actually happens: First, half of that 20% goes straight to income tax. That leaves 10%. But that remaining 10% doesn't preserve purchasing power because of inflation. At the end of the year, these investors actually end up with only 98% of the purchasing power they had at the start - even though they haven't spent a penny of their 'earnings.' What's particularly interesting is that explicit income taxes alone, even at very high rates, can never turn a positive corporate return into a negative owner return. But inflation can. It's like running up a down escalator that's accelerating - at some point, no matter how fast you run, you're still going backwards."

Let me explain why this matters so much. With explicit income taxes, even if the government took 90% of your dividends and capital gains, you'd still have some real income left if inflation was zero. There's always something remaining. But the inflation tax operates differently. It's not bounded by what you report as income - it erodes the entire capital base. When inflation rates get high enough - and we've seen this in recent experience - they can transform what looks like positive returns from most corporations into negative real returns for all owners. And here's the kicker - this happens to everyone, even those who don't have to pay explicit taxes. This is why I believe investors would actually be better off in an environment with stable prices and modest corporate returns of just a few percent than in a high-inflation environment with seemingly higher nominal returns. The hurdle rate - that's the return on equity needed to generate any real return for owners - has shot up dramatically because of this effect. It's created an investment environment where what looks good on paper can actually be destroying real wealth."

Let me give you a concrete example we've seen: When inflation hits 16%, any company earning less than that rate of return - and that's more than 60% of corporate America - is actually delivering negative real returns to its owners. And that's before we even consider explicit taxes! What makes this even more painful is that these two forms of taxation - inflation and explicit taxes - work together in a particularly nasty way. You see, you're paying income taxes on nominal returns, not real returns. So you could actually be paying taxes on what would be losses if measured in constant dollars. This is why I've consistently said that for individual investors in medium or high tax brackets - I'm not talking about tax-free entities like pension funds here - the average American corporation is unlikely to deliver any real long-term return, even if they reinvest all their after-tax dividends. The combination of inflation's implicit tax and explicit taxes on both dividends and capital gains essentially eats up the entire average return on equity."

Now, there are some important exceptions to this rule, but they're just that - exceptions. This is a fundamental challenge that affects virtually all businesses, including Berkshire. Inflation doesn't magically improve our return on equity - that's just not how it works. I want to emphasize this point because sometimes people think large corporations have some special ability to deal with inflation. They don't. The impact of inflation on corporate returns is a structural issue that affects the entire corporate system. We're very straightforward about this at Berkshire - we don't pretend to have some secret formula or special solution that others have missed.

For a business to be truly indexed against inflation, its return on equity must increase in proportion to inflation without requiring any additional capital investment. And when I say additional capital, I mean any kind - working capital included. You see, many people think they're protected against inflation just because their earnings or dividends are growing, but that's not necessarily true. Let me give you an analogy I like to use: Think about a wage earner who saves half their paycheck. Sure, their total money will grow year after year, but that's not indexing - that's just saving. The same applies to corporations. If a company's earnings are growing simply because it's reinvesting profits rather than paying them out as dividends, that's not true indexing. That's just plowing money back into the business. True indexing is when a business can maintain its purchasing power without needing to invest more capital.

Here's the reality: First, on a day-to-day basis, you're still going to be hit with what I call the implicit inflation tax. There's no escaping that. Second, when you eventually decide to convert your Berkshire investment into something else - whether that's another investment or just spending money - you're going to face explicit taxes at that point. So while our reinvestment policy might help defer some taxes, it's not a complete shield. Think of it this way: we're not truly indexed against inflation, and our reinvestment policy, while beneficial for long-term growth, doesn't change the fundamental fact that shareholders still face both inflation effects and eventual taxation. That's just the economic reality we all have to deal with."

Now, some might worry about that $17 million difference staying with GEICO rather than coming to Berkshire, but I'm just as comfortable with GEICO management handling those funds as I would be having them in our own hands.

In GEICO's case, they were designed from the ground up to be the low-cost operator in an enormous market - auto insurance. What's particularly interesting is that most of their competitors were stuck with high-cost marketing structures that they couldn't easily change. That's a tremendous advantage. When you run a business like that properly, you can offer better value to customers while still earning exceptional returns. The key thing to understand is that GEICO's troubles in the mid-70s didn't damage this core economic advantage. It's like having a great machine that just needs some repairs - the basic engineering is still sound. I often tell people to distinguish between temporary problems and permanent ones. In GEICO's case, we saw a wonderful business franchise that had what I'd call a localized, excisable cancer. It needed surgery, yes, but the patient was fundamentally healthy. That's very different from a true turnaround situation where you're trying to transform the basic economics of a business. When you find a business with that kind of durable competitive advantage available at a discount due to temporary problems, that's when you want to act."

When we invested $47 million in GEICO, we were essentially buying $20 million in earning power from a business with first-class economic characteristics. To get that same earning power through buying an entire company with similar qualities would have cost us at least $200 million, and in some industries, much more. What I look for in these situations is what I call an extraordinary business franchise. Both GEICO and American Express had that. They had unique competitive positions that weren't damaged by their temporary problems. The salad oil scandal at American Express in 1964 is a perfect example - it was a serious financial hit, but it didn't change the fundamental value of their credit card franchise or their traveler's checks business. You want to find these special situations where a great business is available at a discount because of problems that can be solved with good management - what I called a skilled surgeon in the case of GEICO. But you have to be very careful to distinguish these situations from companies that need a complete turnaround or transformation of their basic business model."

When an insurance company holds bonds, they can carry them at face value as long as they plan to hold them to maturity - even if the market value has dropped significantly. But the moment they sell those bonds, they have to recognize the loss immediately and adjust their published net worth downward. This creates a real constraint on their flexibility. I've seen cases where it would make excellent business sense for insurers to shift from tax-exempt bonds to taxable bonds, particularly when they're facing large underwriting losses. But they won't make that move solely because they don't want to book the bond losses. It's a bit like refusing to move into a better house just because you don't want to admit your current house declined in value. The unwillingness to recognize these losses can lock companies into sub-optimal positions for decades. That's why we believe in facing financial reality head-on, even when it's uncomfortable."

Take the case of bond prices in the insurance industry - some people spend enormous energy trying to predict whether bonds will rise in price and restore stated net worth, or fall further. But we don't play that game. Look at how some of the largest property-casualty companies have found themselves with nominal or even negative net worth when their bond holdings are marked to market. Could those bonds recover in price? Sure. Could they fall further? Absolutely. But anyone who tells you they know which way it's going to go in the short term is either fooling themselves or trying to fool you.

When you have large unrealized losses in your bond portfolio, you're okay as long as this pool of policyholder funds stays stable or grows. But here's the critical part - if your business volume declines and that pool shrinks, you're forced to sell those bonds to pay off liabilities. And if those bonds are carrying big unrealized losses, well, those losses suddenly become very real and can devastate your net worth. It's like having a warehouse full of merchandise you bought at high prices - as long as business is good, you can hold on, but if sales drop and you need to liquidate inventory at a loss to pay your bills, those paper losses become actual dollars walking out the door. That's why these unrealized losses are much more than just an accounting problem - they can create a real bind in terms of business flexibility and financial stability."

But here's what inevitably happens: Since most insurance policies are price-sensitive and renew annually, you'll start losing business to competitors pretty quickly. That leads to a domino effect - as your premium volume shrinks, your liabilities will decrease on a delayed basis. This forces you to sell bonds to match the declining liabilities, and that's when those paper losses we've been carrying become real losses that show up in the financial statements. It's like watching a slow-motion replay of a car crash - you can see exactly what's going to happen, but you can't stop the sequence once it starts.

Here's where it gets interesting - and by interesting, I mean painful. You have to start selling bonds to match those declining liabilities. And that's when the truth you've been avoiding becomes visible on your financial statements - that disappearing net worth finally shows up. Now, some companies try to be clever about this. They'll sell their better-performing assets - maybe stocks already marked to market or recently purchased bonds where the losses aren't so severe. I call this ostrich-like behavior.

The whole strategy boils down to maintaining premium levels, assets, and liabilities while basically crossing your fingers and hoping for better days - either through improved underwriting conditions or bond prices recovering. Now, the industry press criticizes this approach, and for good reason. What these companies are doing is essentially writing business at a known loss just so they can get their hands on premium dollars to invest at high interest rates. It's a bit like saying, 'Sure, we know we're going to lose money on the insurance side, but we'll make it up on investments.' That's not insurance - that's gambling with other people's money. And in my experience, when you start focusing on investment income rather than sound underwriting principles, you're walking down a pretty dangerous path. The fundamental business of insurance should be about properly pricing risk, not about generating investment float at any cost."

Now, you might ask why any rational business would do this. The answer is that many large insurers feel compelled to maintain their premium volume levels regardless of price adequacy. But here's the real problem - when major players in the industry adopt this 'sell-at-any-price' policy, it forces everyone else to come close to meeting those prices. It's like being in a race to the bottom. And I can tell you that right behind having financial problems yourself, the next worst situation is having competitors with financial problems they can temporarily hide through this kind of pricing strategy. It's a classic case of kicking the can down the road, and it ensures there won't be a better day for underwriting as long as this practice continues.

But that's only half the problem. The real kicker is that these companies lose not just their investment flexibility, but their underwriting options as well. It's a double whammy. Think about it - when you're locked into long-term bonds that you can't sell without taking significant losses, you've lost the ability to adapt to changing market conditions on both sides of your business.

Even more telling, for years after we bought the bank, he would periodically tell me about valuable aspects of the purchase he hadn't even mentioned during negotiations. And at 71 years old, he worked harder for us as an employee than he had for himself as an owner. That's the kind of character you want to see in business.

Under his leadership, the Illinois National consistently achieved the top position nationally in profitability. That's not easy to do while maintaining such high standards of responsibility.

When you're handling other people's money, that kind of transparency and immediacy in problem-solving is absolutely crucial.

They've shared stories about how Gene helped them - sometimes with financial assistance, but always with wisdom, empathy and friendship.
