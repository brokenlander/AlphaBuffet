If a company we own 10% of makes $10 million but doesn't distribute it, we don't report any of that as our earnings unless they pay out dividends. It's like having a fruit tree - just because it produces a lot of fruit doesn't mean you get to eat it all if you don't pick it. In our case, the fruit is the earnings, and we only get to count the part that's picked, or paid out, as dividends."

When stock portfolios fall in price, it can reduce net worth significantly and trigger a reaction. But with bonds, because they're carried at amortized cost rather than market value, a decline in bond prices doesn't necessarily show up on the books right away. It's a bit like ignoring the elephant in the room, but that's how the accounting works."
