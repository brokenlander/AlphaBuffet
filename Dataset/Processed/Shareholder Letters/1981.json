        "value": "Well, let me be clear about this. What we've found is that market values do track business values quite well over long periods, but - and this is important - in any given year this relationship can get pretty wild and unpredictable. You see, market recognition of retained earnings isn't some smooth, predictable process. It varies significantly company by company. In some cases, where management employs earnings poorly, the market recognition can be disappointingly low or even negative. But then you'll see companies that are really skilled at deploying their retained earnings - they get market recognition far greater than dollar-for-dollar. Think of it like farming - you can plant the same amount of seeds, but the harvest varies greatly depending on how well the farmer uses the land. The key is that if you select your non-controlled companies with reasonable skill, the overall group results should work out quite satisfactorily. We're actually quite fortunate that in the securities markets, you can usually find small portions of exceptionally good businesses at reasonable prices. That's harder to do when buying entire companies - those opportunities are rare and usually come with hefty price tags."

We're perfectly comfortable with both total ownership of businesses and with owning marketable securities that represent small portions of businesses. In fact, our non-controlled business interests typically have more favorable underlying economic characteristics than our controlled businesses. Now, that might sound surprising, but it's actually quite understandable when you think about it - our area of choice is far wider in the securities markets. Here's the reality: you can usually find small pieces of exceptionally good businesses at reasonable prices in the securities markets. But trying to buy these same exceptional businesses in their entirety? That's rare, and when those opportunities do come along, they almost always come with high price tags. We're constantly looking for ways to employ large sums in both areas. But - and this is important - we try to avoid small commitments. As I like to say, 'If something's not worth doing at all, it's not worth doing well.' Plus, we have to consider the practical aspects - our insurance and trading stamp businesses actually require us to maintain major investments in marketable securities for liquidity purposes. So we need to be active in both arenas."

Let me be clear - I'd much rather own 10% of a wonderful business at X per share than 100% of that same business at 2X per share. Now, this might seem counterintuitive to some managers who always want full control, but we're interested in the economics, not the bragging rights. You see, we try to avoid small commitments altogether - as I like to say, if something's not worth doing at all, it's not worth doing well. When we do commit capital, we want it to be meaningful and in businesses with real economic substance. Too many managers get caught up in what the acquisition will look like on paper or how it will affect their corporate kingdom. But in my experience, managements that stress accounting appearance over economic substance usually end up achieving little of either. We're looking for real businesses with real value, and we're perfectly happy owning a piece of something great rather than all of something mediocre."

First, there's this matter of animal spirits - leaders generally love activity and challenges. I'll admit, even at Berkshire, our corporate pulse quickens when we're looking at an acquisition. But we try not to let that excitement cloud our judgment. Second, and this is a big one, most organizations measure themselves primarily by size rather than quality or profitability. It's quite telling - ask any Fortune 500 manager where their company ranks, and they'll immediately quote their position by sales size, often not even knowing where they stand on the profitability list. Third, and this might sound a bit whimsical, but I believe many managers were too influenced by fairy tales in their youth - particularly that story about the princess kissing a toad to release the handsome prince. They seem to think they can transform mediocre businesses through the magic of their management. These motivations lead to very different behavior than our approach at Berkshire, where we focus on the underlying economics rather than size or transformation fantasies. We're not interested in turning toads into princes - we prefer to buy princes at fair prices."

If you ask a Fortune 500 executive where their company ranks, they'll instantly tell you their position by sales volume, but they might not even know where they stand on profitability rankings. This creates a fundamental problem in how managers think about and run their businesses. You see, when compensation and recognition are tied more to size than performance, you get exactly what you incentivize - growth at any cost rather than intelligent growth that creates shareholder value. It's like measuring a baseball player only by how many times they swing the bat, rather than their batting average and runs batted in. The size metric alone tells you very little about the actual value being created. I've always believed that what counts isn't just how big you can get, but how much value you're creating per dollar of assets employed. That's why at Berkshire, we focus relentlessly on return on capital and intrinsic value growth, not just getting bigger for the sake of size."

Many managers seem to have this fairy tale notion that their special managerial kiss will somehow transform a mediocre company into a prince of a business. The reality is far less magical. Let me be clear about this - investors can always buy toads at toad prices in the open market. What puzzles me is why shareholders should pay double the price just so their management can play princess and kiss these toads. If you're going to pay 2X instead of X for something, those kisses better pack some real dynamite. But here's what we've seen over the years - lots of kisses, very few miracles. What's particularly interesting is how many managers remain supremely confident about their kissing abilities even when their corporate backyards are full of toads that never turned into princes. Now, to be fair, some companies have shown truly dazzling acquisition records. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. The essential problem is that this rosy optimism, while necessary for making deals, often blinds managers to the reality that most corporate marriages end up looking more like toad collections than royal families."

        "value": "Well, let me be clear about this. There are two essential characteristics we look for in businesses that can thrive during inflation. First, they need the ability to raise prices easily - even when demand isn't growing and they're not running at full capacity - without losing customers or sales volume. Second, they need to be able to handle much larger dollar volumes of business without requiring significant additional capital investment. Now, what makes this really interesting is that while these characteristics sound simple, they're actually quite rare in combination. You see, most businesses either can't raise prices without losing customers, or they need to keep investing heavily as they grow. That's why when you do find businesses with both characteristics, you'll notice the competition to acquire them has become, as I've observed, 'fierce to the point of being self-defeating.' Even managers of ordinary ability who've focused solely on acquiring businesses with these two characteristics have done quite well over recent decades. But here's the catch - the very success of this strategy has made it increasingly difficult to execute profitably. It's like trying to find a bargain at an auction where everyone knows exactly what they're bidding on."

What we're seeing is that many managers act like princesses in fairy tales, convinced their kiss - or in this case, their management touch - can turn any corporate toad into a prince. The reality is that their corporate backyards often end up 'knee-deep in unresponsive toads.' Now, there are two paths to successful acquisitions that we've observed. The first is straightforward - buying businesses with those inflation-resistant characteristics I mentioned earlier. But the second path is more interesting - it involves what I call the managerial superstars. These are the rare executives who have two special abilities: they can spot a prince disguised as a toad, and they have the management skills to remove that disguise. I particularly admire people like Tom Murphy at Capital Cities Communications - he's what I call a real managerial 'twofer' because he excels at both identifying the right acquisitions and managing them effectively afterward. But here's the key point - too many managers overestimate their ability to transform businesses through acquisitions. They keep kissing toads, expecting princes, but end up with, well, just more toads. The successful acquirers are either very disciplined about buying businesses with specific characteristics or are exceptional managers with a proven ability to spot and develop undervalued businesses."

Category 2 managers are what I call the managerial superstars - they're the rare individuals who can spot a prince disguised as a toad and have the operational abilities to transform that business. Think of folks like Ben Heineman at Northwest Industries or Tom Murphy at Capital Cities Communications. Murphy is particularly special because he's what I call a 'twofer' - he's skilled both at acquisitions and operations. But here's the key thing - these Category 2 managers are extremely rare. In fact, these champions have made very few deals in recent years, often finding that buying back their own shares is the smartest use of capital. I'll be frank - I don't qualify for Category 2 myself. And while we understand the economics of Category 1 pretty well, our actual acquisition record there has been spotty. As I like to say, we violated the Noah principle: predicting rain doesn't count, building arks does. We've tried buying toads at bargain prices, but our kisses didn't turn them into princes. When we've done well, it's been with businesses that were already princes when we bought them, or when we've bought pieces of obvious princes at toad-like prices."

What we've learned is that success comes in two forms: either buying clear princes from the start - and I emphasize they were princes when purchased - or finding opportunities to buy partial interests in easily-identifiable princes at toad-like prices. The key lesson here is about knowing your limitations. While some exceptional managers like Tom Murphy or Henry Singleton have the rare ability to spot and transform undervalued businesses, I've had to acknowledge that I don't possess those Category 2 management skills. This recognition has been important in shaping our strategy. Despite understanding the economic principles that should guide Category 1 acquisitions, our actual performance has been sporadic and inadequate. I've had to admit that our preaching was better than our performance. It's like that Noah principle I mentioned - it's not enough to predict rain, you've got to build the ark. In our case, understanding good acquisition principles wasn't enough; we needed to execute better on those principles."

For entire businesses, we're willing to pay what I'd call a 'fairly fancy price' for what we call Category 1 businesses, but only if we're reasonably confident about what we're getting. The key is that the future needs to make sense even if it develops along the lines of its past. Now, here's an important point - we won't pay extra for what we're supposedly bringing to the party, because frankly, we usually don't bring much. In 1981, for example, we walked away from a deal with both a business and manager we liked because the price would have made our owners poorer, even though it would have made our empire bigger. On the flip side, we've found we can often get better values through buying fractional interests in excellent businesses with good management through the open market. Sometimes we can find what I like to call 'princes at toad-like prices.' The market occasionally offers these fractional interests at very attractive valuations, particularly when we can identify businesses with excellent franchises and competent, honest management teams."

Just look at my aluminum industry prediction last year. I had to make what you might call a minor adjustment to my rosy outlook - only about 180 degrees worth! The beauty of non-controlling positions is that when we're wrong, we can admit it and move on much more easily than if we owned the whole company. The key is to find businesses where we can be a substantial junior partner and achieve good economic results while supporting the long-term objectives of existing owners and managers.

Let me give you a perfect example that's a bit embarrassing but illustrative. Last year, I shared what I thought was my expert opinion on the wonderful future of the aluminum business. Well, I had to make what we'll politely call some minor adjustments to that view - adjustments that totaled about 180 degrees! This is why we're so focused on being honest about our mistakes and learning from them. We've made plenty of such errors both in our controlling and non-controlling investments.

Now, this has very real implications for investors. What we've observed at Berkshire is that our corporate efforts will do a much better job of filling your wallet than filling your stomach - meaning the nominal returns might look good, but the real purchasing power is another story entirely. The unrelenting destruction of currency values forces us to think this way.

Let me put it in perspective: several decades ago, if you had a business generating a 10% return on equity, that was considered a 'good' business. And there was sound economic logic behind this benchmark. When long-term taxable bonds were yielding 5% and tax-exempt bonds were at 3%, a business that could generate 10% on equity capital was clearly worth a premium to investors. The economic case for equity investment has traditionally rested on this premise - that you'll derive additional earnings above passive investment returns through the application of managerial and entrepreneurial skills. Plus, since you're taking more risk with equity capital, the thinking goes that you're 'entitled' to higher returns. But here's where it gets interesting - we need to question whether this value-added bonus from equity capital is as natural and certain as many assume. The equity value-added proposition that seemed so clear in earlier decades needs to be carefully examined in today's environment. What was once considered a good return might not meet the same threshold today, which has significant implications for how we think about equity investments."

Even after accounting for the tax effects - both on dividends and capital gains - which might reduce that 10% to something like 6-8% in an investor's pocket, it was still attractive. During this period, American businesses were typically earning about 11% on equity, and the market recognized this value by pricing stocks at significant premiums to book value - often more than 150 cents on the dollar. These businesses were 'good' because they were earning substantially more than what I call their 'keep' - the return available on passive, long-term investments. The value-added from equity investment was quite substantial in those days. But I have to emphasize - that day is gone, though many of us still carry those old metrics in our heads."

It doesn't accomplish much and can slow down your response time. The key is finding the right balance. The difficulty is that we're dealing with deeply ingrained lessons from a different era. These lessons become part of our investment DNA, so to speak, and they're remarkably difficult to discard even when conditions change.

That 14% business return gets hit twice essentially. First, the corporation pays its taxes, then the individual investor pays taxes on what's left. So when you have interest rates at those levels, a typical American business isn't worth a full dollar on the dollar to individual investors anymore. Let me give you a specific example I like to use: Take an investor in a 50% tax bracket. If a company pays out all its earnings, that investor's actual return after taxes becomes equivalent to about a 7% tax-exempt bond. And here's the kicker - if nothing changes, if the company keeps paying out all earnings and maintains that 14% return on equity, that individual investor is just as frozen at that 7% equivalent as they would be with a tax-exempt bond. It's a very different story for pension funds and tax-exempt investors, but for individuals, these interest rate levels fundamentally change the equation of business ownership."

But - and this is a big but - when the pace of change accelerates, sticking to yesterday's assumptions can be incredibly costly.

Think about it this way: the comfortable metrics and rules of thumb that worked well for decades can become dangerous traps when the underlying economic conditions shift dramatically. It's much easier - and I mean much easier - for both investors and managers to keep using their familiar tools and metrics rather than rethinking their premises daily.

To get it there, you'll have to pay capital gains tax, which tops out at 20%. When you compare this after-tax return to what you could get from passive investments, it often works out to be inferior. It's simple mathematics, but it's an unpleasant fact that both corporate managers and investors sometimes prefer to ignore. But as I always say, facts don't cease to exist just because they're unpleasant or because we ignore them. The reality is that unless passive rates fall, companies achieving 14% per year gains while paying no dividends are failing their individual shareholders because the returns from passive capital are actually better than these active returns after considering taxes."

If we look at a typical company that pays out all its earnings as dividends and has a 14% return on equity, what does the investor actually get? After paying that 50% tax, the income return to the investor becomes equivalent to what they'd get from a 7% tax-exempt bond. Now, if this situation continues - meaning all earnings keep getting paid out and the return on equity stays at 14% - that 7% tax-exempt equivalent is essentially frozen, just like the coupon on a tax-exempt bond. In today's market, such a perpetual 7% tax-exempt bond might be worth about fifty cents on the dollar. This is why dividend policy matters so much - it directly impacts what shareholders actually get to keep after Uncle Sam takes his share. Most American businesses fall somewhere in between, paying out a significant portion of earnings rather than all or nothing. The key is understanding how these payout decisions, combined with tax rates, affect the real returns that end up in shareholders' pockets."

Right now, many American businesses are producing less for their individual investors after-tax than they could get from a simple tax-exempt passive rate of return. That's the fundamental problem. Now, here's what's interesting - and perhaps counterintuitive: This isn't happening because companies are performing worse than before. In fact, they're actually doing a bit better, with return on equity improving by a few points over the past decade. But here's the key - the passive return rate, what I call the 'crossbar,' has been rising much faster due to inflation. Think of it like a high jump competition. Our businesses are actually jumping higher than before, but the crossbar keeps getting raised even faster. The really troubling part is that most companies can't do much about this except hope for the crossbar to come down. And that crossbar is largely influenced by inflation. If we can get long-term inflation under control, we'd see passive returns fall, and many of these currently 'bad' businesses would become 'good' again. But until that happens, these businesses are stuck in an especially tough spot."

Most American businesses pay out a significant portion of their earnings, and they're caught in this situation where their returns aren't beating what you could get through passive investments. Now, I want to be clear - facts don't cease to exist just because they're unpleasant or because we ignore them. This is our reality right now. Sure, there are still some high-return businesses that remain attractive even under these conditions - we're not saying every business is in trouble. But when we look at the big picture, the aggregate situation, we're seeing American equity capital failing to create additional value beyond what passive investments could provide. This is particularly important for investors to understand because it challenges the traditional assumption that equity investments will naturally provide superior returns. The crossbar of passive return has been elevated much faster than business performance has improved. It's like we're running up a down escalator - even though we're moving our legs faster, we're not getting ahead. This creates a real dilemma for investors looking for value creation through equity investments."

That way, shareholders can earn premium returns on a growing capital base. It's like compounding interest - you want to keep reinvesting at those high rates. But when you have a business earning poor returns - let's say 5% on equity - it makes no sense to retain those earnings. The shareholders would be better served if the company paid out most earnings as dividends so they could reinvest that capital somewhere more productive. I like to use the bond analogy here: If you own a 5% bond, you wouldn't take those coupons and buy more 5% bonds at full price when similar bonds are available at forty cents on the dollar. You'd look for better returns elsewhere. The same principle applies to shareholders. Even the Bible agrees with this approach - in the parable of the talents, the high-performing servants got to retain and reinvest all their earnings, while the poor performer had his capital taken away and given to the top performer. It's just common sense - good money shouldn't be thrown after bad."

It's a double whammy, if you will. The business is already generating subpar returns, and inflation forces them to keep plowing those meager earnings back into the same low-return operation. Now, reason would actually suggest doing the exact opposite. When returns are poor, you want to get that capital out of the business and into something more productive. But these economically 'bad' businesses often can't do that - they're trapped in a cycle of having to retain earnings just to maintain operations. It's worth noting that many of these 'bad' businesses wouldn't be in this category under different economic circumstances. But inflation can turn what might otherwise be an acceptable business into a real capital trap. The key lesson here is that inflation doesn't just erode purchasing power - it can force businesses into retention policies that compound already poor returns."

Let me explain it this way: In normal conditions, as the biblical parable of talents suggests, you'd want the high-performing enterprises to retain and reinvest their earnings while the poor performers should distribute capital to better users. But inflation completely reverses this logic. When you have persistent inflation, the low-return business must retain every nickel it can, not because it's a good use of capital - quite the opposite - but because it has no choice if it wants to maintain its existing operations. Think of inflation as a corporate tapeworm that needs to be fed daily, regardless of how healthy or sick the host business is. This tapeworm demands more dollars for receivables, inventory, and fixed assets just to maintain the same level of business operations. The cruel irony is that the weaker the business, the more it needs to retain just to stay in place. A company earning 8% or 10% on equity often finds its plate cleaned completely by this tapeworm, leaving nothing for growth or real dividends. It's a forced retention, not a choice."

It's preemptive and non-negotiable. Even if a business reports zero profits, it still needs more dollars flowing into receivables, inventory, and fixed assets just to maintain the same unit volume as the previous year. It's important to understand that this isn't optional - the tapeworm must be fed. And here's the really insidious part: the less profitable the enterprise, the greater the proportion of available resources the tapeworm consumes. Think about it - a business earning modest returns of 8% or 10% on equity often finds that the tapeworm of inflation has cleaned their plate entirely, leaving nothing for expansion, debt reduction, or real dividends. The business is forced to retain earnings not because it's a good investment, but because inflation gives it no choice if it wants to maintain its existing operations."

I particularly want to warn about so-called 'dividends' that can only be paid if someone promises to replace the distributed capital. That's not a real dividend - that's financial engineering. At Berkshire, we take a different approach. We retain earnings for offensive reasons, not because we're backed into a corner or have obligations we can't meet. But I'll be straight with you - even we're feeling the pressure from escalating passive returns on equity capital. We're still clearing that hurdle, but just barely. Our historic 21% return provides only a modest margin over current after-tax rates on passive money, and that's not guaranteed for the future."

Right now, we're still maintaining our historic 21% return, which gives us a modest margin over current after-tax rates on passive money. But I want to be very clear - that return is not at all assured for the future. We're particularly mindful of the capital gains tax rate, which we expect to rise considerably in future years. This will further squeeze that margin we're working with. It's like clearing a high jump bar - we're still making it over, but our feet are brushing the bar more than they used to.

The costs of repairs - whether it's property or medical care for people - just keep marching upward. And what insurers are being held responsible for keeps expanding too. Looking at the numbers, we need at least a 10% annual increase in premium volume just to stay even with the underwriting losses that are already baked in. Every percentage point below that just accelerates the deterioration. The quarterly numbers from 1981 tell us this terrible picture is getting worse faster and faster.

Then you've got the age-old problems: managers' worship of size over profitability and this notion that if you give up market share, you'll never get it back. What's particularly troubling is that even though the entire industry acknowledges rates are inadequate, virtually no major property-casualty insurer has been willing to turn down enough business to where their cash flow turns significantly negative. They're essentially choosing a slow bleed over a quick pain.

To put this in perspective, what we're likely to see is that even the best underwriting years in the coming decade may look poor compared to what we considered an average year in the past decade. This isn't a cycle in any meaningful sense - it's more like a structural shift downward. The dynamics we're seeing with insurers being forced to maintain cash flow at any cost, combined with the industry-wide reluctance to accept negative cash flow, creates a persistent downward pressure on prices that isn't going to simply correct itself through normal cyclical patterns.
