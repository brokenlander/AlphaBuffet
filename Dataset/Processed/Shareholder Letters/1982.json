If management has shown it's insensitive to the interests of owners, shareholders will suffer from a lower price-to-value ratio for their stock compared to other stocks. It's a long-term consequence, and no amount of assurances from management can quickly undo the damage. Investors will be cautious, and that caution will be reflected in the stock's market value."

Think of it like a trade - we want to make sure both parties get a fair deal. This approach, I believe, is why the market gives us a premium. When managers demonstrate they won't issue shares on unfavorable terms, it shows we're looking out for the owners' interests, and that's valued by the market."

We also want to see consistent earning power, not just promises of future growth. The business should have good returns on equity, minimal debt, and a simple business model that we can understand. And, importantly, the management team should already be in place. We're not looking to fix broken businesses or get into complex technologies. We want solid, well-run companies that can continue to thrive under our ownership."

Phil, at National Indemnity Company, and Ben, at Associated Retail Stores, made our shareholders a good bit wealthier through their outstanding performance. Phil, along with his predecessor Jack Ringwalt, was instrumental in National Indemnity's success, which has been the most important operation in Berkshire's growth. Ben, on the other hand, hit business home runs for us for fifteen years after selling Associated Retail Stores, demonstrating his care and drive in running the business as if he owned it himself."

If we can continue to attract managers like these, I'm confident about Berkshire's future."
