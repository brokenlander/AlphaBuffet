        "value": "Well, you raise an important point about measurement systems. Look, I'll be direct - our operating earnings fell to 9.8% of beginning equity capital in 1982, down significantly from 15.2% in 1981 and way below our 19.4% peak in 1978. But here's the key thing - this decline wasn't necessarily reflecting poor management. It came from three specific factors: our insurance underwriting results deteriorated, we expanded our equity capital without proportionally growing our directly-operated businesses, and we put more money into partially-owned businesses where accounting rules prevent us from fully reflecting our share of earnings. Now, you should be skeptical when any manager starts saying their old measuring stick isn't relevant anymore. As I like to say, yardsticks rarely get thrown out when they're showing good numbers. Most managers prefer to dispose of the yardstick rather than face their own shortcomings. But in our case, the nature of our business truly has evolved to where this particular metric doesn't tell the whole story anymore. We believe in having clear, consistent, long-term performance measures - what I call pre-set, long-lived and small bullseyes - rather than drawing convenient targets around wherever our arrow happens to land."

Too many managers behave like archers who shoot their arrow first and then carefully draw the bullseye around wherever it landed. It's a common pattern I've observed: when performance deteriorates, instead of addressing the real issues, managers often try to change the way performance is measured. They'd rather dispose of the yardstick than face disposal of the manager. This is exactly the opposite of what we believe in at Berkshire. We favor what I call pre-set, long-lived and small bullseyes - in other words, consistent, challenging standards that don't move around based on convenience. Now, occasionally there are legitimate reasons to change measurement systems, as we've done at Berkshire. But you should always be suspicious when a manager starts explaining why their old performance metrics don't matter anymore. Remember, yardsticks seldom are discarded while yielding favorable readings. The key is to distinguish between genuine evolution in business circumstances and mere excuse-making for poor performance."

In GEICO's case, we had $23 million in undistributed earnings that were completely excluded from our reported operating earnings. Here's the interesting part - if GEICO had performed worse but paid out more dividends, our reported earnings would have looked better. And if they had earned an extra $100 million but retained it all, our reported earnings wouldn't have changed a bit. That's why I prefer looking at economic earnings, which include all undistributed earnings, regardless of ownership percentage. The real value to owners comes from how effectively those retained earnings are used, not from the size of the ownership stake. This isn't a criticism of accounting procedures - I wouldn't want the job of designing a better system. But it's crucial for managers and investors to understand that accounting numbers are just the beginning, not the end, of business valuation."

If you owned just .01 of 1% of Berkshire during the past decade, you benefited economically in full measure from your share of our retained earnings, regardless of what your accounting system might show. You did just as well, proportionately, as if you had owned the magic 20%. But here's the flip side - and this is important - if you owned 100% of many capital-intensive businesses during that same period, those retained earnings that were credited fully to you under standard accounting methods might have resulted in minor or zero economic value. The key is not the percentage you own, but rather how effectively those retained earnings are put to use by the business. That's what determines the real economic value to all owners."

In our case at Berkshire, we have many large ownership positions under 20% that are extremely important to our actual economic reality, but they don't show up properly in our reported earnings. Let me give you a concrete example from our experience. In 1982, we had major holdings in companies like GEICO, General Foods, Washington Post, and R.J. Reynolds Industries. Our share of their undistributed earnings was over $40 million - more than our total reported earnings! But on our books, we only showed the $14 million in dividends we received. The accounting rules simply don't capture the economic reality of these ownership positions. For most corporations, this might not matter much because they don't have significant under-20% positions. But for us at Berkshire, it's a very different story. That's why I always emphasize that our reported operating earnings figure has limited significance in understanding our true economic position."

Take our 1982 experience - we predicted over $35 million in undistributed earnings from just four of our major non-controlled holdings, and we actually ended up with well over $40 million. That's substantial, especially when you consider it exceeded our total reported earnings. But here's the important caveat that investors need to understand: these retained earnings aren't as clean and simple as they might appear on paper. The realization of these earnings through improved market valuations is subject to very substantial taxation - and that taxation is indeterminate. That's why I say we shouldn't try to calculate these numbers to ten decimal places. It's important to understand the general magnitude, yes, but we have to be realistic about the complications involved in eventually realizing these values. And remember, we're not just talking about our major holdings - we have numerous smaller ownership interests that also have substantial undistributed earnings in aggregate."

While retained earnings over the years have generally translated into at least equal market value for shareholders, it's important to understand that this translation isn't smooth or predictable. Let me be clear about this - the process is both extraordinarily uneven among companies and irregular in timing. Think about it like this: in some cases, we've seen retained earnings have practically no impact or even a negative impact on market value. But then in other cases - and these are the ones we really like - a dollar retained by a company translates into two or more dollars of market value. Now, you also have to factor in that when Berkshire realizes these retained earnings through improved valuations, it's subject to very substantial taxation - though we can't precisely determine how much. That's why while we pay attention to these numbers, we don't believe in carrying them to ten decimal places. The key is finding businesses where each dollar of retained earnings will eventually translate into at least a dollar of market value.

When you're buying fractional interests in businesses through the stock market, you get to select from almost the entire array of major American corporations. This includes many businesses that are far superior to virtually any company you could buy outright in a negotiated deal. But here's what makes it really interesting - these fractional-interest purchases happen in an auction market where prices are set by participants whose behavior patterns sometimes resemble those of an army of manic-depressive lemmings. That's not just colorful language - it's a reality that creates real opportunities. Think about it: this very unevenness and irregularity in how the market prices these fractional interests is actually an advantage for the patient, value-oriented purchaser. It means that occasionally, due to this manic-depressive behavior of market participants, you can buy pieces of wonderful businesses at very attractive prices. This is fundamentally different from trying to buy entire businesses in negotiated transactions, where you rarely see such dramatic mispricing opportunities."

You see, in some of our investments, when a company retains a dollar of earnings, it has virtually no impact on market value - sometimes it's even negative. But in other cases - our really good businesses - each dollar retained might create two or more dollars of market value. The key is that our winners have more than made up for our laggards. This is why we focus on maximizing what I call 'economic earnings' rather than getting too caught up in 'accounting earnings.' It's about the real value creation, not just the numbers on paper. So far, this approach has worked well for us, and if we can keep finding these corporate overachievers, we'll continue to benefit from this philosophy."

But here's the catch - it's extraordinarily difficult to do this right, much more so than buying fractional interests. Looking at 1982 specifically, I felt relief rather than envy when I saw the major acquisitions others were making. What we witnessed was a classic case of managerial adrenaline overwhelming managerial intellect. I'm reminded of Pascal's observation that 'all men's misfortunes spring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly in one room.' In fact, I'll confess that I almost got caught up in these Acquisition Follies myself. One of our biggest accomplishments that year was actually a failure - a large acquisition we had committed to couldn't be completed for reasons beyond our control. In retrospect, that was a blessing.

In 1982, we had firmly committed to a very large purchase that, fortunately for us, fell through for reasons beyond our control. I say fortunately because this deal would have consumed an extraordinary amount of our time and energy, all for what I'd call a most uncertain payoff. You know, it's funny - if we were to put together an annual report showing our best business moves that year, the centerfold would just be two blank pages representing this blown deal. The key lesson here is that you need to be disciplined about your acquisitions and not get caught up in the excitement of doing deals just to do deals. We're always looking for attractive businesses at attractive prices, but the emphasis has to be on both parts of that equation. Sometimes the best thing you can do is simply walk away, even if you've invested time and energy into a potential deal.

When the market gets too expensive, our ability to effectively deploy capital in partial-ownership positions gets reduced or eliminated entirely. We've seen this before - just look at what happened during the two-tier market mania ten years ago, when high-return-on-equity businesses were bid up to the sky by institutional investors. During that period, our insurance subsidiaries owned only $18 million in market value of equities, excluding their Blue Chip Stamps interest. That's because no matter how excellent a business is, paying too high a price for its stock can undo a decade's worth of favorable business developments. You can't make up for a too-high purchase price even if the underlying business performs well for years afterward. That's why we need a moderately-priced stock market to execute our strategy effectively."

The businesses were the same, but the prices the market was asking for them were simply absurd. While high stock prices might make our performance look good in the short term, they actually hurt our long-term business prospects. We're starting to see early signs of this problem again.

But - and this is important - I want to be very clear that this percentage will decrease in the future. It's not just me being modest; it's simple mathematics. As I like to say, geometric progressions eventually forge their own anchors. Think about it this way: our gain in net worth during 1982 alone was $208 million on a beginning net worth base of $519 million - that's 40%. But as our base gets larger and larger, maintaining such high percentage gains becomes increasingly difficult.

In fact, we have a corporate creed around here that simply says 'Let Jack Do It.' But here's the important point: while GEICO's market value has shot up more than its intrinsic business value over the past two years, we actually expected this kind of thing to happen eventually. It's what occurs when investor perception finally catches up with business reality. The key is understanding that these variations won't always work in our favor. Even when our partially-owned businesses perform well economically, there will be years when their market performance is poor. That's just how markets work.

Second, if they've been adequately reserved in the past, giving them a cushion to work with. Third, if they're growing very rapidly. Now, what we've seen, particularly in 1982, is that several large insurers chose to use some pretty obscure accounting and reserving maneuvers to hide significant problems in their core business. As I like to say, 'It's difficult for an empty sack to stand upright.' When management is weak and operations are weak, they often resort to weak accounting. Even honest management teams might unconsciously be less willing to fully recognize negative trends when profits are down. That's why industry statistics from 1982 showed some deterioration in loss reserving practices, and the true combined ratio was likely worse than what was being reported."

Even with today's lower general inflation rate, we're facing three key factors that make meaningful improvement unlikely. First, we've got the number of policies increasing year after year. Second, medical inflation is running way ahead of general inflation - that's a big cost driver in our business. And third, we're seeing a broadening of what's considered insured liability. When you put all these factors together, it's highly unlikely that yearly increases in insured losses will fall much below 10%. Take that 1982 combined ratio of 109.5 - that's actually a 'best case' estimate. The reality might be even worse given what we know about some of the accounting practices being used. So while many in the industry are predicting the 'cycle' will turn toward better results, I'm seeing structural factors that suggest otherwise."

Now, in the insurance industry, we're seeing exactly this play out.

Third, you can have what I call 'extra-legal' cartelization, like what OPEC does with oil, which can create benefits even for non-cartel operators in the same market. But here's the key point - if you don't have one of these artificial supports, and you're facing full-bore competition with excess capacity in your industry, and your customers don't particularly care whose product they use, you're going to face some very tough economics. It's just mathematics. The market forces will eventually win out.

Now, there are exceptions where companies in commodity businesses can do well if they have a sustainable and significant cost advantage.

But here's the rub - when that correction finally happens and profitability returns, something predictable occurs. That taste of prosperity often creates this widespread enthusiasm for expansion. Everyone gets excited and starts building new capacity. And wouldn't you know it, within a few years, we're right back where we started - overcapacity and a profitless environment. The key thing to understand is that the long-term profitability in these industries ultimately comes down to a simple ratio: how many supply-tight years do you get compared to supply-ample years?

Unfortunately, in many industries, this ratio tends to be quite dismal. I remember in our textile business, the last supply-tight period we had was so brief it barely lasted a morning! The insurance industry faces this challenge in a particularly acute way. Unlike manufacturing businesses where adding capacity requires long lead times and complex facilities, insurance capacity can be created instantly. All you need is capital and an underwriter willing to sign their name. To make matters worse, with state-sponsored guaranty funds protecting policyholders, even the capital requirements aren't as stringent as they used to be. So what you end up with is an industry that almost always operates under substantial overcapacity, except in rare circumstances like major market crashes or catastrophic natural disasters. When you combine this persistent overcapacity with the fact that insurance is largely a commodity product - where many customers don't even know their insurer's name - you've got yourself a textbook case of challenging business conditions."

In some industries, we see two main scenarios that can lead to extended periods of tight capacity. First, you might have situations where the actual demand growth consistently runs ahead of what was forecast. This creates a natural constraint on supply that can last for quite a while. Second, and this is particularly interesting, some industries have inherent barriers to adding capacity because they require complex manufacturing facilities that take considerable time to plan and build. These lead times act as a natural brake on supply growth. But here's where insurance is fundamentally different - and not in a good way. In insurance, we don't have these natural constraints. You don't need to build factories or complex facilities. You don't need years of planning. All you really need is capital and a willingness to write policies. This is why the insurance industry almost always operates with substantial overcapacity, making it much harder to maintain profitable conditions. It's a stark reminder that the structural characteristics of an industry can have a profound impact on its long-term economics."

That's usually a recipe for disaster in business. But here's what made it different: the industry operated under what I'd call a 'gentlemanly' system of regulated pricing. You see, for much of the 20th century, we weren't seeing true price competition among the major players. Instead of companies fighting for customers on price, they were mainly competing for agents through non-price means. The real pricing decisions happened through negotiations between industry bureaus and state regulators. Once those prices were set, Giant A had to charge the same as Giant B - it was actually illegal to cut those filed rates. What's particularly interesting is that these negotiated prices included specific profit allowances. When losses showed the prices weren't profitable, both the companies and regulators would work together to fix that. So while it looked like a commodity business on the surface, the regulatory structure actually created a much more favorable competitive environment than you'd expect. That's why from 1950 through 1970, the industry's combined ratio averaged 99.0, which meant all investment income plus 1% of premiums went straight to profits."

Instead of companies competing directly on price to win customers, which is what you'd normally see in a competitive market, the pricing was set through a very different process. The large insurance companies would negotiate rates through industry 'bureaus' with state regulators. Think of it as a dignified haggling session - but importantly, it was between the company and the regulator, not between the company and the customer. Once these rates were filed and approved, that was it - the law actually prohibited both companies and agents from cutting those rates. So if you were Giant A or Giant B, you knew your competitor couldn't undercut you on price. The system also had a built-in protection mechanism. These negotiated prices included specific profit allowances, and there was an understanding that if losses showed the prices weren't profitable, both the companies and regulators would work together to correct it. The competition that did exist was mainly focused on winning over agents through various non-price strategies. This created a much more predictable, profitable environment than you'd typically see in a commodity business with excess capacity."

It was quite a comfortable arrangement - unlike most industries, insurers could legally price their way to profitability even when there was overcapacity. But that world is gone now. We've got new players who've completely changed the game. These newcomers aren't bound by the old traditions - they're using different distribution methods and, most importantly, they're very willing to use price as a competitive weapon. In fact, they love doing it. The customers have caught on too. They've learned insurance isn't a one-price business anymore, and believe me, that's not knowledge they're going to forget. Many industry managers are still looking in the rear-view mirror, trying to operate like it's still the old days. But that's not going to work.

But here's the crucial difference, and it's what makes our situation in insurance particularly challenging: we can't experience a demand surge like those other industries can. You see, while a copper producer might benefit from a sudden increase in demand that tightens the market, insurance policies don't work that way. There's no equivalent catalyst that could create that kind of market tightness in insurance. This is a fundamental constraint we have to deal with in our industry. Unfortunately, many managers and analysts are still analyzing the business through that rear-view mirror I mentioned, not fully appreciating this reality.

The only way to improve conditions in insurance is through supply contraction. And here's the key point - this supply is mental, not physical. We don't need to shut down plants or companies. What needs to change is the willingness of underwriters to put their names on policies. But here's the catch - this contraction won't happen just because profits are poor. Poor profits cause a lot of complaining, but they don't cause major insurance providers to give up large portions of their business. They won't sacrifice market share that easily. What we really need is what I call a shock factor - a natural or financial 'megadisaster.' That's what causes major capacity withdrawals.

The irony here - and I love pointing out these ironies in business - is that if you were selling your entire business, you too could probably get full intrinsic value. But when you're making what amounts to a partial sale of your company through issuing shares, you're stuck with whatever value the market assigns to your stock.

It's really that simple. The beauty of these situations is that they create a perfect laboratory for shareholders to observe what management truly values - are they empire builders focused on expanding their domain, or are they careful stewards of shareholder capital? The math isn't complicated: when you use undervalued shares for acquisitions, you're diluting existing shareholders by paying more than you should for the acquired assets. A management team that proceeds with such transactions is telling you, through their actions rather than their words, that growing bigger is more important to them than protecting shareholder value.

But your ownership - your piece of our wonderful businesses like See's Candy Shops and National Indemnity - would automatically be reduced. And here's another flawed argument I often hear: 'The company we're buying will be worth more in the future.' Well, of course it will! But presumably the business interests you're trading away will also be worth more - future prospects are already built into the valuation process.

I've seen plenty of deals that weren't dilutive to current earnings but destroyed value instantly, and conversely, some dilutive deals that actually enhanced value over time.

You've got to face all the consequences before the moment of ecstasy, as I like to say when comparing corporate deals to pregnancy."

I believe we need more precise language, even if it's a bit more awkward. What's really happening is that part of Company A is being sold to acquire Company B, or the owners of B are receiving part of A in exchange for their properties. This isn't just semantics - it's about clear thinking. The clearest example of this dynamic is in the case of investment companies. Take a situation where Investment Company X, trading at 50% of asset value, wants to merge with Investment Company Y. If X issues shares equal to 100% of Y's asset value, you can calculate exactly what's being given up versus what's being acquired. The key point is that in any trade, what you're giving is just as important as what you're getting. This remains true even when you don't know the final tally of what's being given up until later. Too many managers focus on what they're getting while glossing over what they're giving up in return."

If X issues shares equal to 100% of Y's asset value, they're essentially trading $2 of intrinsic value for $1 of value. That's obviously destructive to X's shareholders, and in the regulated investment company world, the SEC wouldn't allow it. Now, while it's easier to calculate these values precisely with investment companies, we see this same type of value destruction happening in manufacturing, service, and financial company mergers. The problem is that managements often fail to use the same yardstick to measure both businesses in the transaction. They'll use one set of metrics for their own company and another for the target, which leads to these value-destroying decisions. What's particularly troubling is that when management has a history of making these kinds of poor capital allocation decisions, the market applies what I call a 'double whammy' - first, you lose intrinsic value through the merger itself, and then the market rationally applies a lower multiple to your business because it doesn't trust management's capital allocation skills. It's like getting punched twice for the same mistake."

        "value": "This is absolutely crucial, and I'll tell you why. While it's true that manufacturing, service, and financial companies aren't as easily valued as investment companies where we can precisely calculate asset values, the principle remains the same. The destruction of shareholder value we see in many mergers could not happen if management and directors would simply assess the fairness of transactions by using the same yardstick in measuring both businesses. Think about our investment company example - if you're trading stock worth 50 cents on the dollar for assets at full value, that math simply doesn't work. The SEC recognizes this in the investment company world and wouldn't allow such a transaction. But in other industries, where the calculations aren't as precise, managements often use different standards for measuring their own company versus the target company. This inconsistency leads to poor decisions that destroy shareholder value. I've always believed that good business judgment requires consistency in how you evaluate both sides of a transaction. When management abandons this principle, they're not serving their shareholders' interests, and the market eventually recognizes this through lower valuations of companies that engage in such practices."

        "value": "Well, what happens is quite rational and predictable. When management demonstrates they're willing to destroy owner wealth through unintelligent share issuances, the market applies a lower valuation multiple to that business. Think about it this way - if you have two companies with identical operating abilities, but one has management that's shown disregard for owners while the other has demonstrated a clear distaste for anti-owner actions, which would you pay more for? It's like that restaurant analogy I like to use - when you find a bug in your salad, the waiter's assurance that it's a one-time event doesn't suddenly restore your confidence. Not only are you less likely to order salad there again, but folks at nearby tables who witnessed this will think twice too. The market responds the same way to management's anti-owner actions. Once that trust is broken, shareholders suffer from a lower price-to-value ratio for a very long time, regardless of management's promises that it won't happen again. That's why at Berkshire, we're absolutely committed to only issuing shares when our owners receive equal or greater business value in return."

It's really that simple. At Berkshire and any company where we have a say in policy, we follow this principle religiously. We will not issue shares unless our owners receive at least equivalent business value in return. You see, we don't believe in equating mere activity with progress, or corporate size with owner wealth. This is fundamental to how we operate. When management demonstrates this kind of commitment to shareholder interests, the market rewards that behavior with higher valuations. It's a matter of trust and alignment of interests. The market is quite rational in this regard - it places a premium on management teams that have shown they can be trusted to act as careful stewards of shareholder capital. This isn't just theory - we've seen this play out consistently over decades in the market."

We want to see what a business has actually done, not what someone hopes it might do. The business needs to earn good returns on equity without much debt - that's crucial. We also insist on having management in place because, frankly, we can't supply it ourselves. And here's something that surprises some people: we want simple businesses. If there's lots of technology involved, we won't understand it, and we're pretty upfront about that. We don't equate activity with progress or corporate size with owner-wealth. That's a trap many fall into, but we're focused on actual value creation, not just getting bigger for the sake of it. And one more thing - we need to know the price upfront. We don't want to waste anyone's time, including our own, talking about deals without knowing the price tag."

We prefer cash purchases, though we'll consider using stock in certain circumstances. As for our shareholder-designated contributions program, we're quite proud of how it's working. This past year, we saw 95.8% of eligible shares participating, which is remarkable considering we reduced the designation amount from $2 to $1 per share. Looking ahead, if our merger with Blue Chip goes through, we expect to achieve a consolidated tax position that should significantly expand our contribution base. That means we might be able to offer larger per-share designation amounts in the future.

The beauty of a compact organization is that we can focus our time and energy on actually managing the business rather than managing each other. You see, when you start building layers of management and expanding staff unnecessarily, you create bureaucracy. And bureaucracy is like a tax on productivity. We've found that with the right people - and we have the right people - a small team can accomplish extraordinary things. This approach has served us exceptionally well at Berkshire. We don't need fancy offices or large corporate staffs to run a successful operation. In fact, we just expanded our World Headquarters by 252 square feet, which is a mere 17% increase.

We're completely interchangeable when it comes to business decisions, which is a tremendous advantage. Here's something I've learned over the years: a single phone call between Charlie and me is typically more productive than a half-day committee meeting. We don't need elaborate management structures or constant face-to-face meetings to make things work. It's about having the right partner who shares your thinking and values. When you have that - as I do with Charlie - geography becomes irrelevant. This approach will continue whether or not the Blue Chip merger occurs.

You see, when you have managers with this kind of character, it becomes your good fortune as an owner. In Phil's case, he and Jack Ringwalt before him made National Indemnity our most important operation in terms of Berkshire's growth. Ben took Associated Retail Stores and kept hitting home runs for us for fifteen years, well beyond his original commitment. What made them special wasn't just their business acumen - it was their fundamental character. They had this attitude embedded in them long before we came along. That's why I always say that if we can continue to attract managers with these qualities - this ownership mentality and innate drive - shareholders don't need to worry about Berkshire's future.

Then you look at Ben Rosner - here's a fellow who sold Associated Retail Stores to Diversified Retailing Company in 1967, initially agreeing to stay just through the end of that year. Instead, he stayed on for fifteen years, consistently delivering outstanding results - what I call business home runs - for our shareholders. Both were retiring - Phil at 65 and Ben at 79 - but their impact on Berkshire's success was remarkable. The wealth they created for shareholders came from their combination of operational excellence and complete dedication to the business. When you find managers who can deliver these kinds of results while treating the business as their own, that's when you've found something truly valuable for shareholders."
