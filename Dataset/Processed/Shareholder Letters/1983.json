While Berkshire is technically structured as a corporation, Charlie and I have always viewed it as a partnership in spirit and practice. We see ourselves as managing partners and our shareholders as owner-partners. Now, given the size of our personal holdings, we're also controlling partners - for better or worse. But here's the key point: we don't view Berkshire as the ultimate owner of our business assets. Instead, we see the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own those assets. This isn't just talk - we back it up with action. Our board members are all major shareholders themselves. In fact, for at least four of our five directors, over 50% of their family net worth is in Berkshire stock. As I like to say, we eat our own cooking. This alignment of interests between management and shareholders is fundamental to how we operate."

Now, this is important - we don't measure Berkshire's significance or performance by its overall size. The metric that matters to us is per-share progress. I should be candid here: we know with certainty that our rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future. That's simply mathematics - a greatly enlarged capital base will make it impossible to maintain the same percentage gains. But let me be equally clear about our expectations: we will be disappointed if our rate of progress doesn't exceed that of the average large American corporation. This focus on per-share value rather than absolute size is crucial because it aligns directly with what matters to our owner-partners - their actual investment returns."

You see, because we have this two-pronged approach to ownership - both directly owning businesses and holding marketable securities through our insurance operations - conventional accounting doesn't tell the whole story of our economic performance. What we really care about, and what we report to our shareholders, are the earnings of each major business we control. These individual business unit numbers are far more meaningful than the consolidated figures. Let me give you a concrete example: When we have a choice between purchasing $2 of earnings that accounting principles won't let us fully report, versus $1 of earnings that we can report, we'll take the $2 every time if the acquisition costs are similar. The accounting consequences simply don't factor into our operating or capital allocation decisions. What matters is the underlying economic reality, not how it shows up in the consolidated statements."

That's always our primary goal. But we're also perfectly happy with our second choice, which is owning parts of similar businesses through marketable common stocks, primarily through our insurance subsidiaries. Now, how do we decide between these two in any given year? It's actually driven by two key factors: first, the price and availability of businesses, and second, our insurance capital needs. We have to be flexible because we can't control when good businesses will be available at attractive prices. And let me be completely candid - we know our rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future. That's just mathematics - our enlarged capital base makes that inevitable. But we still expect to exceed the average return of large American corporations. If we don't, we'll be disappointed."

When we're looking at acquisitions where the costs are similar, we actually prefer to buy $2 of earnings that we can't report under standard accounting principles rather than $1 of earnings that we can report. Now, this might seem counterintuitive to some folks, but here's the reality we often face: We can buy entire businesses where the earnings will be fully reportable, but they frequently cost us double the price of buying smaller portions where the earnings largely won't show up in our reported numbers. Why do we take this approach? Because we're focused on the long-term intrinsic business value, not just what shows up in the accounting statements. Over time, we expect those unreported earnings to be reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains. We're not trying to make our books look pretty - we're trying to create real value. It's like choosing between two apple trees - one where you can count all the apples but there are fewer of them, versus another where you can't count them all but you know there are twice as many.

Now, here's something important: we will absolutely walk away from interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. Has this conservative approach hurt our results? Yes, it has. But we sleep better at night knowing we're being responsible with other people's money. You see, we have fiduciary obligations to multiple stakeholders - our policyholders, our depositors, our lenders, and particularly our equity holders who have often placed unusually large portions of their net worth in our care. These aren't just abstract obligations to us - they're real responsibilities to real people who've trusted us with their financial futures. So while we might leave some money on the table by being conservative with debt, it's the only approach that leaves us comfortable. We won't risk the farm just to try to make a few extra dollars.

Our test is simple: for every dollar of earnings we retain, we should be delivering at least one dollar of additional market value to our shareholders over time. Now, we don't just check this once and forget about it. We evaluate this on a five-year rolling basis to ensure we're consistently meeting this standard. I'll be completely candid with you - this gets harder as our net worth grows. It's like trying to steer a bigger and bigger ship - the bigger it gets, the more challenging it becomes to make meaningful moves with additional capital. But this is the test we've set for ourselves, and so far, we've managed to meet it.

I've always believed that candor isn't just good for our shareholders - it's actually beneficial for us as managers too. There's a real danger when CEOs start playing fast and loose with the truth in public communications - they often end up deceiving themselves in private. That's a slippery slope you don't want to go down. Now, this doesn't mean we share everything - we're quite reserved about discussing our marketable securities positions beyond what's legally required. That's because good investment ideas are like gold nuggets - they're rare and valuable.

Now, this doesn't mean we practice what I call 'gin rummy management' - we don't just discard our weakest business at every turn. That's not our style at Berkshire. We're actually willing to have our overall results penalized a bit to avoid that kind of approach. We take a more long-term view and work with what we have.

You see, this ban isn't just about stocks we're buying - it extends even to securities we've already sold, because we might want to purchase them again. Here's the problem: if we start responding to rumors by denying some but saying 'no comment' on others, those 'no comments' effectively become confirmations. It creates what I'd call an information leak through selective disclosure. Think about it - if we deny nine rumors but stay quiet on the tenth, we've essentially confirmed that tenth rumor without saying a word. That's why we maintain a consistent policy of not commenting at all. It's like the old saying - the only way to keep a secret is to keep it completely. This approach might seem overly cautious to some, but in the investment world, where information is incredibly valuable, it's the only way to maintain our operational effectiveness."

But what's remarkable is how she overcame these obstacles. She learned English from her daughter, who would come home from school and teach her mother the words she'd learned that day. Then in 1937, with just $500 in savings from selling used clothing, she launched what would become Nebraska Furniture Mart. Now, I often quote Pascal about how 'all the misfortunes of men spring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly in one room.' But even Pascal would have left the room for Mrs. Blumkin. She went up against rich, established competitors with no locational advantage and barely any capital. Yet she succeeded through pure determination and business acumen. When you think about starting a furniture business with just $500, going against entrenched competition, and building it into something remarkable - well, that's the kind of business story that gets my attention."

When she ran out of money early on, she didn't give up - she sold furniture right from her home to keep her promises to creditors. That's the kind of integrity that builds lasting business relationships. She also understood the power of competitive pricing and wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo. When established retailers tried to shut her out by pressuring manufacturers, she found alternative ways to get merchandise. And when they took her to court over Fair Trade laws, she turned that challenge into an opportunity. Not only did she win those cases, but she got invaluable publicity and even sold carpet to the judge! That's what I call turning lemons into lemonade. The result? A single 200,000 square-foot store that generates over $100 million in annual sales and outsells all Omaha competitors combined. It's a perfect example of how determination, integrity, and customer-focused business practices can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles."

What's remarkable is that even today, no other home furnishings store in the country comes close to their volume. Think about that - a single 200,000 square-foot store generates over $100 million in annual sales and outperforms all local competitors combined. That's what I call a sustainable competitive advantage. It wasn't built on fancy strategies or financial engineering, but on fundamental business principles: better deals for customers, relentless focus on costs, and an unwavering commitment to value. When competitors tried to stop her through legal challenges and supplier pressure, she found ways to adapt and emerge stronger. That's the kind of business that's hard to compete against, even with unlimited resources.

They achieve this through two key mechanisms: brilliant buying and incredibly efficient operations. Their expense ratios are so low that competitors can't even imagine operating at those levels. And here's the beautiful part - they pass much of those savings on to customers, which creates a virtuous cycle. You know, I always ask myself how I'd compete with a business if I had unlimited capital and the best people. In this case, I'd rather wrestle grizzlies than go up against Mrs. B and her family.

She personally sells more carpet than what would be a good departmental total for other retailers. Then you've got Louie Blumkin, her son, who's widely regarded as the shrewdest furniture and appliance buyer in the country. When we purchased the business, we deliberately structured the deal to keep the family involved - we bought 90% but left 10% with family members in management, plus we optioned another 10% to key young family managers. This wasn't just generosity - it was good business.

The main virtue of book value is its simplicity - it's easy to calculate and doesn't require making subjective judgments. But here's the key thing to understand: book value and intrinsic value are very different measures. Book value is purely an accounting concept that shows you what's been put into the business, both from capital contributions and retained earnings. Intrinsic value, on the other hand, is an economic concept that estimates what you can get out of the business in the future, discounted to present value. Think of it this way - if you're looking at a business, book value tells you what you've invested, but intrinsic value tells you what you might earn on that investment. And those can be very different numbers. Just like spending the same amount on two different children's college educations - the input (book value) might be identical, but the future payoff (intrinsic value) could vary enormously.

Because all of that book value was tied up in textile assets that simply couldn't earn an appropriate rate of return. This illustrates a crucial point about business valuation - just because you have assets on the books at a certain value doesn't mean they can generate corresponding returns. It's like our education analogy - you can spend the same amount educating two different students, but one might go on to generate tremendous value while the other might generate very little. The same applies to businesses. Two companies might have identical book values, but their ability to generate future cash flows - their intrinsic value - can vary enormously.

I like to compare it to having invested in an education that turned out to be largely wasted - you've got the degree on paper, but it's not creating real value. Now, the situation has completely flipped. Our intrinsic value is significantly higher than our book value. Think of it like having assets that are worth far more than what shows up in the accounting statements. This happens for a couple of reasons, but primarily because we've acquired businesses with substantial economic Goodwill that isn't fully reflected in the books.

By the end of 1983, this created a hidden value of about $70 million pre-tax, or $50 million after tax, that wasn't showing up in our book value but was certainly part of our intrinsic value. But the second reason is actually more significant - we own several businesses that have economic Goodwill far exceeding their accounting Goodwill. Now, I know Goodwill can make people's eyes glaze over - in fact, I often say you can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking about Goodwill and its amortization. But the reality is that the economic value of our businesses is much greater than what shows up in the accounting statements. It's like having a fantastic business franchise whose true worth can't be captured by traditional accounting methods.

This bias caused me to make many important business mistakes of omission - not so much buying the wrong things, but missing out on great opportunities. What really changed my thinking was business experience, both direct and vicarious. Over time, I came to strongly prefer businesses that possess large amounts of enduring goodwill and that utilize a minimum of tangible assets. It's interesting because most of what I learned from my early teachers continues to be extraordinarily valuable, but this was one area where I had to unlearn my initial training. The reality is that economic and accounting goodwill can, and usually do, differ enormously.

I've included an appendix about goodwill and its amortization in our letter because I believe students of investment and management should understand these nuances, even though it gets a bit technical. The key thing to understand is that there's often a huge gap between economic goodwill and accounting goodwill. While we provide detailed information about our reported earnings and ownership structures, like our involvement with Blue Chip Stamps, the real story of Berkshire's value isn't fully captured in these conventional accounting measures. That's why I recommend the appendix to those who are comfortable with accounting terminology and want to truly understand the business aspects of goodwill. It's not necessary for everyone - as I said, you can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking about goodwill and its amortization - but for serious investors trying to value Berkshire, it's an important concept to grasp."

And I'll tell you straight - I don't see this improving significantly for the rest of the decade. Here's why: with inflation - and we remain very pessimistic about inflation - the industry needs premium volume to grow about 10% annually just to keep loss ratios where they are now. That's not progress, that's running in place. As Yogi Berra would say, 'It will be deja vu all over again.' The figures will bounce around, sure, but the fundamental challenges aren't going away.

It's like steering a large ship - there's a significant delay between turning the wheel and seeing the ship change course.

I can't just hand off these results to Mike Goldberg, who recently took over most of the insurance operation, because these numbers were baked in long before his arrival.

Since most Berkshire shares trade in fairly substantial blocks, the average spread across all trading probably doesn't exceed 2%. But here's what I think is really important - our true turnover rate, excluding things like inter-dealer transactions, gifts, and bequests, runs at about 3% per year. This is dramatically different from the hyperactive trading we see in many other stocks. We've structured things this way deliberately because we believe in long-term ownership rather than constant trading. It's a more efficient approach that avoids the excessive costs and market friction that come with hyperactive trading.

When you have a higher share price, you tend to get investors who are more focused on business fundamentals and long-term value. Splitting the stock would likely bring in more short-term oriented investors, which would make our stock price less consistently related to intrinsic business value.

Now, under accounting rules, that $17 million difference would be considered Goodwill and amortized over 40 years, creating an annual charge against earnings that isn't tax deductible. But here's the key point - that's just accounting. The economic reality is quite different. See's was earning $2 million after tax on that $8 million of tangible assets - that's a 25% return, which was and still is remarkable. The true economic Goodwill is the capitalized value of that excess return - the premium that See's could earn above typical market rates. You see, when a business can consistently earn returns far above market rates on its tangible assets, it's worth far more than just the value of those assets. That's economic Goodwill, and it's very different from the accounting treatment.

Now, in 1972, and even today, very few businesses can consistently achieve that kind of performance. The crucial point here - and this is something every investor should understand - is that the premium value isn't coming from the fair market value of the inventories, receivables, or fixed assets. It's coming from the business's ability to generate superior returns on those assets. When you find a business that can do this consistently, you've found something special. The excess return gets capitalized into what we call economic Goodwill. This is why, when evaluating businesses, you can't just look at the balance sheet and add up the tangible assets.

You see, when a customer has countless positive experiences with both your product and your people, you develop what I call a consumer franchise. This franchise lets you price based on the value to the customer rather than just the production cost. That's economic Goodwill in action. It's similar to what you see with TV stations that have government licenses - they can earn premium returns because they have something special that others can't easily replicate. In See's case, customers weren't making their purchasing decisions based on the cost of sugar or chocolate - they were buying because of their trust in the See's name and their previous good experiences. That's why we were willing to pay $17 million over net tangible assets for See's.

But here's the key point: while accounting Goodwill was decreasing on our books, the real economic Goodwill of See's was actually increasing. The consumer franchise was getting stronger, not weaker. Berkshire owned 60% of Blue Chip at the time, so our balance sheet showed about $7.5 million of See's Goodwill. When we later acquired the rest of Blue Chip, we had to use purchase accounting rather than pooling treatment. The accounting makes it look like Goodwill is a wasting asset that declines over time, but in a business like See's with a strong consumer franchise, the economic reality is just the opposite.

We can prove this by looking at See's performance: they earned $13 million after taxes on about $20 million of net tangible assets. That kind of performance tells us there's real economic Goodwill that's far larger than what we originally recorded as accounting Goodwill. So while the accountants were steadily decreasing Goodwill on our books, the actual economic Goodwill was growing substantially, albeit irregularly.

See's was earning about $2 million on $8 million of net tangible assets - that's a very attractive return that indicates substantial economic Goodwill. Now, contrast that with what I'll call a mundane business. Let's say this business also earned $2 million, but required $18 million in net tangible assets to generate those earnings. That's only an 11% return on tangible assets, and at that level, the business would have little or no economic Goodwill. The key difference here is that See's could generate the same earnings with less than half the tangible asset base. That's the power of economic Goodwill - it allows a business to earn superior returns without requiring proportionally more tangible assets. This is why we're always looking for businesses that can earn good returns on tangible assets, because it often indicates the presence of valuable economic Goodwill."

Both might earn $2 million, but here's the key difference: the mundane business needs $18 million in tangible assets to operate, while See's needs less than half that. When inflation hits, both businesses need to double their nominal earnings to $4 million just to stay even. Now, here's where it gets interesting - both businesses typically need to double their investment in tangible assets too. That's because inflation forces you to put more dollars into receivables, inventory, and eventually fixed assets. But - and this is crucial - if you're starting with $18 million in required tangible assets, doubling that is a much bigger burden than if you're starting with a smaller asset base. That's why businesses with lower tangible asset requirements, like See's, can be worth more even with the same earnings. They simply need less capital reinvestment to cope with inflation. It's a fundamental principle that many investors miss - you've got to look at not just what a business earns, but what it needs to keep earning it."

A business earning 11% on tangible assets, like our hypothetical mundane business example, possesses little or no economic Goodwill. That's why it might sell for just the value of its tangible assets - in our example, $18 million. But See's was different. We paid $25 million for it, even though it had the same earnings and less than half the tangible assets. Why? Because economic Goodwill isn't about the physical assets - it's about the earning power relative to required tangible investment. When you have a business that can earn good returns with minimal tangible asset requirements, you've got something special. In an inflationary world, this becomes even more valuable. Think about it - if inflation forces you to double your tangible asset base, wouldn't you rather be doubling from a smaller number? That's why we were willing to pay more for See's. The economic Goodwill represents the ability to earn excess returns without requiring proportionally more tangible investment. It's like having a built-in inflation protection mechanism. That's the kind of business characteristic that becomes more valuable the longer you own it."

When inflation hit, See's needed to put up $8 million in additional capital, while the mundane business needed $18 million just to stay in place. Here's the important part: both ended up earning $4 million annually, but See's gained $25 million in nominal value for its $8 million investment - that's over $3 of value for each dollar invested. The mundane business only gained a dollar of nominal value for every new dollar invested - basically the same as putting money in a savings account. But remember, even See's had to put up that $8 million just to stay even in real profits. That's the brutal reality of inflation - any business that requires net tangible assets to operate gets hurt. The difference is just in how badly they get hurt, and businesses with lower capital requirements like See's tend to fare better than capital-intensive operations."

As I mentioned in the example, if you see a doubling of dollar sales, you need correspondingly more dollars tied up right away in receivables and inventories. You can't escape it. Then there's the fixed assets - they respond more slowly to inflation, but they respond just as surely. The critical thing to understand is that none of this additional investment produces any improvement in your rate of return. You're not investing for prosperity - you're investing for survival. Think about it this way: even with a wonderful business like See's, which had relatively modest capital requirements, we still had to commit an additional $8 million just to stay even in real profits. This isn't optional - it's mandatory capital you have to put up simply to maintain your competitive position. That's why I emphasize that inflation hurts any unleveraged business that requires net tangible assets to operate, and almost all businesses do. The investment isn't about getting ahead - it's about not falling behind."

The conventional wisdom - which I'd say was long on tradition but short on wisdom - used to be that you wanted businesses full of hard assets, plants, and machinery during inflation. You know, the 'In Goods We Trust' philosophy. But that's not how it actually works. Here's the reality: businesses that require lots of tangible assets typically earn low returns, and during inflation, they barely generate enough capital to fund their own inflationary needs. Think about See's Candies - even they needed $8 million in additional capital just to maintain their real profits. The businesses that truly shine during inflation are those that combine intangible assets of lasting value with minimal tangible asset requirements. Look at the communications business - it's a perfect example. These businesses don't need massive capital investments, but their franchises endure and their earnings can grow substantially in nominal dollars. Plus - and this is key - they have more capital available for acquiring new businesses because they're not constantly reinvesting just to stay in place. The real winner during inflation is economic Goodwill - it's truly the gift that keeps on giving."

Let me give you a practical example from our experience. When you look at businesses during inflationary periods, you'll notice something interesting - a disproportionate number of the great business fortunes were built through operations that combined intangible assets of lasting value with minimal tangible asset requirements. The communications business is a perfect case study. These businesses didn't need huge investments in physical assets, but their franchises - their economic Goodwill - remained valuable and even grew. This economic Goodwill becomes incredibly valuable during inflation because it doesn't require the same constant capital reinvestment that physical assets do. It's important to understand that I'm talking about true economic Goodwill here - not just accounting goodwill. When you have real economic Goodwill, your earnings can grow in nominal dollars, and those dollars are actually available for acquiring new businesses rather than just maintaining existing operations. That's why I say Goodwill is the gift that keeps giving during inflationary periods."

The problem is that there's a lot of what I call spurious accounting Goodwill floating around out there. Here's what happens: When management gets overexcited and pays a silly price for a business, they have to put that premium somewhere on the books. So it gets dumped into the Goodwill account, whether it represents real economic value or not. I sometimes joke that in these cases, we should call it 'No-Will' instead of Goodwill, because it really represents a lack of managerial discipline rather than true economic value. The accounting rules require this Goodwill to be carried on the books for 40 years, just as if the acquisition had been sensible in the first place. But just because accounting treats both types of Goodwill the same way doesn't make them economically equivalent. True economic Goodwill represents real business value and competitive advantage. The other kind just represents management's poor judgment in paying too much."

Consider a company with $20 per share in tangible net worth that's developed something really valuable - maybe a strong consumer franchise or some prime television stations received through FCC grants. Now, if this company earns $5 per share, that's a 25% return on tangible assets, which is excellent. With economics like that, the stock might well sell for $100 per share or more. When an investor pays that $100 price, they're effectively paying $80 per share for Goodwill, just like a corporate buyer would. Now, here's the key question: Should that investor subtract a $2 per share annual amortization charge ($80 divided by 40 years) to calculate what they consider 'true' earnings? I'd argue that this kind of mechanical adjustment doesn't reflect economic reality. When you have a business with strong intangible assets that were developed internally or obtained through good fortune rather than acquisition, the accounting treatment of Goodwill becomes particularly disconnected from the economic truth. The earning power of these intangible assets is what matters, not how accounting rules say we should amortize them."

I'll give you a concrete example from our own experience - when we merged with Blue Chip, what we actually paid for 40% of the Goodwill of See's and the News was substantially more than the $51.7 million that showed up on our books. The accounting treatment doesn't change the economic reality.

But I want to be absolutely clear - this is not the right approach. When evaluating business acquisitions, amortization charges should be ignored entirely. You shouldn't deduct them from earnings, and you shouldn't deduct them from the cost of the business. The correct approach is to forever view purchased Goodwill at its full cost, before any amortization. What matters is the business's earning power on its tangible assets - that's what tells you about the economic reality. The accounting treatment of Goodwill amortization is just that - an accounting convention that doesn't reflect the underlying economics of the business."

That's the real cost to us and our shareholders, regardless of what the accounting statements might say. You see, the market price of securities at the time of merger, or whether we got pooling treatment for accounting purposes - these aren't what matter. What matters is the true economic cost.

You see, operations that look like winners from the first perspective might not look so attractive when you consider the purchase price. Let me put it this way: even the finest business in the world can be a poor investment if you pay too much for it. That's why when we evaluate acquisition opportunities, we focus on both the operating economics and the return we can expect based on our purchase price. And again, we completely ignore the accounting implications. For instance, our books show net Goodwill of $62 million, but we believe the real economic Goodwill is far higher than that. The key is to find that sweet spot where you get both - a great business at a price that makes sense."
