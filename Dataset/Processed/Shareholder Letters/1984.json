We've historically achieved a 22.1% compounded annual gain in book value over twenty years, going from $19.46 in 1964 to $1108.77 in 1984. So when you look at our 13.6% gain in 1984 against that backdrop, it's merely mediocre. It's like having a star basketball player who normally scores 30 points a game suddenly scoring only 20 - still good, but not up to their standard. The key thing to understand is that economic gains must always be evaluated by comparison with the capital that produces them. That's the only way to get a true picture of performance. Book value serves as a useful proxy for us, though it's somewhat understated. In my judgment, both our intrinsic business value and book value increased at about the same rate in 1984, but neither hit the mark we've set historically."

Looking ahead, even achieving 15% annually over the next decade would require profits aggregating about $3.9 billion, assuming we maintain our present dividend policy. Now, to accomplish something of that magnitude, we need big ideas - and I mean really big ones. Small ideas just won't cut it anymore. Charlie Munger, my partner in general management, and I are always on the lookout, but I have to be honest - we don't have any such ideas at present. However, our experience has shown that they do pop up occasionally. And that's about as detailed as our strategic plan gets! It's a straightforward situation where the mathematics of a larger capital base make it increasingly difficult to maintain the percentage returns we've enjoyed in the past. That's just the reality we're dealing with."

When companies with outstanding businesses and comfortable financial positions find their shares selling far below intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action can benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases. But - and this is important - my endorsement of repurchases is strictly limited to those dictated by price/value relationships. I want to emphasize that this absolutely does not extend to what we call 'greenmail' repurchases, which I find completely odious and repugnant. The key here is that when a great business finds its shares significantly undervalued, repurchasing those shares benefits all shareholders, including those who don't sell. We've participated in several proportionate redemptions ourselves at Berkshire, and while we enjoy the low tax charge on these, we genuinely believe they're at least equally favorable for the shareholders who maintain their positions. It's simple economics - when you reduce the share count at prices below intrinsic value, you increase the ownership stake of every remaining shareholder in a wonderful business."

However, we've had to make some practical compromises with accounting treatments - as we did with the New York position we disagreed with - to avoid qualified auditor opinions. But here's what's crucial to understand: none of these accounting decisions affect the intrinsic business value. Our ownership interests, our cash position, our taxes, and the market value and tax basis of our holdings all remain exactly the same. What we do in these situations is first, ensure we're making decisions based on economic substance, and second, prominently identify any special transactions in our reports to shareholders. We believe in being completely straightforward about these matters, even when accounting rules might not perfectly align with economic reality."

When a company finds its shares trading well below intrinsic value and has both an outstanding business and strong financial position, repurchases are the most reliable way to benefit shareholders. It's simple arithmetic, really. When you buy back shares at prices significantly below their intrinsic business value, you immediately increase the per-share value for remaining shareholders in a meaningful way. But - and this is crucial - I'm only talking about repurchases driven by price-to-value relationships. I absolutely do not endorse what we call 'greenmail' repurchases. Those are completely different and, frankly, repugnant. In greenmail, you've got this awful situation with three players: First, you have the extortionist shareholder who basically shows up with a 'your-money-or-your-life' threat to management. Then you've got the corporate insiders who want peace at any price - as long as someone else is paying. And finally, you have the innocent shareholders whose money is used to pay off the extortionist. It's nothing more than a mugging where everyone except the regular shareholders gets what they want. The distinction between these two types of repurchases couldn't be more stark."

When companies execute major repurchases at prices well below the intrinsic business value per share, they immediately create significant value for remaining shareholders. That's the obvious benefit, and it's powerful. But there's also a more subtle reason that isn't always well understood. You see, all of our major investment holdings have engaged in significant stock repurchases when they've seen wide gaps between market price and true value. This tells us something important about management's thinking and their commitment to shareholder value. When we see companies we've invested in making these moves, it confirms they understand value and are willing to act decisively when opportunities arise. The key here is that these repurchases must be done at the right price - that's absolutely critical. We're looking for companies with outstanding businesses and strong financial positions making these moves when their shares are truly undervalued in the marketplace. When those conditions are met, no other action can benefit shareholders as reliably as repurchases."

When we can buy back our shares significantly below their intrinsic value, we're essentially getting $2 of value for every $1 we spend. That's an immediate gain for remaining shareholders. It's far better than what we typically see in corporate acquisitions, where companies often struggle to get even $1 of value for each dollar they spend. The second benefit is more subtle but equally important over time. When management demonstrates - and I emphasize demonstrates because that's the key word here - through repurchases that they're focused on shareholder value rather than empire building, it sends a powerful signal to the market. Investors start to recognize that management is working for them, not against them. This recognition leads them to revise their expectations upward, which ultimately brings market prices more in line with business value. It's entirely rational that investors would pay more for a business run by managers who have proven they're on the shareholders' side versus one run by managers who might be marching to their own drummer."

When we look at repurchases done at the right price, we can often get $2 of value for each $1 spent. It's simple and measurable. But with corporate acquisitions, we see a discouragingly different story. Not only do they rarely achieve that kind of return, but in many cases, they fail to get anything close to $1 of value for each $1 expended. This is a crucial distinction that many managers either don't understand or choose to ignore. The reason I emphasize this point is that it highlights a fundamental choice managers face: they can either build their empire through acquisitions, which often destroys shareholder value, or they can enhance shareholder wealth through intelligent repurchases. When management chooses the latter, they're demonstrating their commitment to shareholder interests. And that demonstration - not just words, but actions - is what separates excellent management from those who might be more interested in building their own kingdom than creating shareholder value."

You see, it doesn't matter how many times they use fancy phrases like 'maximizing shareholder wealth' in their press releases. The market isn't fooled, and neither should you be. I've seen this play out repeatedly in my experience. Look at our major holdings - GEICO, Washington Post, and General Foods. These companies have prospered tremendously through large share repurchases at bargain prices, and so have their shareholders. The key word here is 'demonstrated' - we want to see actions, not just words. When we find managers who combine excellent business economics with shareholder-conscious decisions like intelligent repurchases, we feel very comfortable maintaining large positions. It's a bit like the old saying - actions speak louder than words. And in this case, the action - or inaction - on share repurchases speaks volumes about management's true dedication to shareholder interests."

We have prospered in a very major way through the large share repurchases of our three largest holdings - GEICO, Washington Post, and General Foods. And more recently, Exxon, our fourth-largest holding, has also been wisely and aggressively repurchasing shares. In each of these cases, shareholders have had their interests in outstanding businesses materially enhanced by repurchases made at bargain prices. This isn't theoretical - it's demonstrated in our results. When you look at our portfolio, you'll see we've put substantial capital behind this conviction. For instance, our GEICO holding, which cost us about $45.7 million, had a market value of $397.3 million. That's the kind of result you can get when you combine excellent business economics with shareholder-conscious management. The key is finding managers who understand that repurchasing shares at attractive prices is one of the most effective ways to increase shareholder value.

Second, they have this remarkable ability to understand exactly what they're good at - their circle of competence, if you will - and they stick to it with incredible discipline. Third, and this is crucial, they completely ignore anything outside that circle, no matter how tempting it might look. Fourth, they maintain the highest standards of integrity in all their dealings. Mrs. B summed it up perfectly when she said 'sell cheap and tell the truth.' That's not complicated, but it's amazingly powerful when executed with their level of commitment. When we bought 90% of NFM, we didn't even need an audit or inventory check - we gave Mrs. B a check for $55 million based purely on her word. That's how much we trusted their integrity. These principles have allowed them to save customers at least $30 million annually while earning excellent returns on capital. It all started with a $500 investment in 1937, and look what they've built."

This is the beauty of their model. By operating with such efficiency and passing those savings on to customers, they're able to constantly expand their geographical reach beyond just the natural growth of the Omaha market. It's a wonderful example of doing well by doing good. The foundation of all this is their well-managed operation and their adherence to Mrs. B's philosophy of 'sell cheap and tell the truth.' Remember, this whole enterprise grew from a $500 investment by Mrs. B in 1937. When you combine this efficient business model with their extraordinary work ethic and focus on their area of special competence, you get something really special. That's why I've always said we're fortunate to be in partnership with the Blumkin family.

What we've observed is that while first-class newspapers make excellent profits, the profits of third-rate papers are as good or better - as long as they're dominant in their community. The key here is dominance. You see, once a newspaper achieves dominance, it's the newspaper itself, not the marketplace, that determines its quality level. And here's the interesting part - even a poor newspaper remains essential to most citizens because of what I call its 'bulletin board' value. Sure, a higher quality paper might get somewhat better readership, but even a lower quality paper will still command citizens' attention, and what commands citizens' attention will inevitably command advertisers' attention. It's quite different from, say, making furniture or selling insurance, where poor quality will usually drive customers away. In newspapers, that dominant position creates a unique economic moat that persists regardless of quality."

At the News, we approach this in two ways. First, we make a concrete commitment to above-average expenditure for news - that's our quantitative standard. It's measurable and it matters. But money alone isn't enough. We also rely on our management team to maintain strict qualitative standards. Charlie and I view newspapers as very special institutions in society - they're not just ordinary businesses. They carry a civic responsibility that goes beyond just making profits. That's why we're so focused on having the right people in place who understand this mission. When you have a business where the market won't punish you for lower quality, it becomes even more critical that management steps up to maintain high standards. It's about having that internal commitment to excellence, even when external forces aren't requiring it."

We're looking at three key factors that drive loss costs up by about 10% each year: you've got your basic unit volume increases, general inflation, and those judicial rulings that keep expanding what insurance policies have to cover. Now, here's what's interesting - we tested this theory from 1979 to 1984. A 10% annual premium increase would have given us a 61% total increase over that period, keeping the combined ratio near the 100.6 we saw in 1979. But what actually happened? The industry only managed a 30% premium increase, and look what happened - the combined ratio shot up to 117.7 in 1984. That's why we keep saying that the year-to-year change in premium volume is really the key index to watch if you want to understand where underwriting profitability is heading.

That would mean doubling the industry's total volume by 1989, and frankly, we think that's highly unlikely. What we're more likely to see is a few years where premium gains run a bit above that 10% level we talked about. But then - and this is important - we expect the industry to fall back into its old habits of highly-competitive pricing, which will probably keep the combined ratio stuck in the 108-113 range. It's just the nature of the business - as soon as things start looking better, competition heats up, and pricing discipline goes out the window.

It's like finding a silver dollar in a haystack of pennies. But what's especially telling is GEICO's own experience. Despite having excellent management - and we're talking about truly talented people like Jack Byrne, Bill Snyder, and Lou Simpson - the company hasn't been able to achieve superior profitability in any area outside its core business.

That's exactly what we have with Jack and Bill running the insurance operations and Lou handling the investments. They understand their competitive advantage and stick to what they do best, rather than trying to branch out into areas where they don't have that same edge."

The core challenge lies in determining actual costs, particularly when it comes to losses on claims. You see, many of the losses that should be counted against current year revenue are exceptionally difficult to estimate. What makes this especially tricky is that sometimes we don't even know the full extent of these losses - or even if they exist - for decades after the fact. When you look at a property/casualty company's income statement, you're really looking at four different components: losses paid during the year, estimates for reported but unsettled claims, estimates for incidents that happened but haven't been reported yet (what we call IBNR), and adjustments to previous years' estimates. It's this complexity and uncertainty in loss reserving that makes it so challenging to get a truly accurate picture of current earnings. That's why I always emphasize looking beyond just the reported numbers to understand the underlying business fundamentals."

        "value": "Well, this is really one of the fundamental challenges in the insurance business. Let me explain why. When we report our income statement for property/casualty operations, we're dealing with four types of loss figures. First, you have the straightforward losses that occurred and were paid during the year. That's simple enough. But then it gets trickier - we have to estimate losses that were reported but haven't been settled yet, plus losses that occurred but haven't even been reported to us yet (what we call IBNR). And on top of that, we're constantly revising our previous years' estimates. Here's the key thing to understand: if we make a mistake in our estimates - and some error is inevitable given how much estimation is involved - we have to correct it eventually. I'll give you a concrete example from our experience. Let's say we had an injury claim in 1979 that we estimated would cost us $10,000. We'd record that as an expense and set up a reserve. But if we ended up settling it five years later for $100,000, we'd have to charge our earnings with an additional $90,000 in 1984, even though that cost really belonged to 1979. So you can see how this creates a sort of domino effect where both the original year's earnings and the correction year's earnings end up being misstated. That's why I always emphasize looking at insurance results over longer periods."

The extensive use of estimates means some degree of error is absolutely unavoidable. Even with the most honest and competent management team, these estimates will be off to some degree. Think about it this way - if that 1979 claim I mentioned was our only piece of business that year, and we estimated it at $10,000 when it ultimately cost us $100,000, we would have completely misled both ourselves about our true costs and our shareholders about our actual earnings. And here's what makes it particularly tricky - these errors might not become apparent for decades. That's why I always tell our shareholders to be very careful about how they interpret any single year's results in the property/casualty business. The numbers you see, despite their precise appearance, contain hidden assumptions and estimates that may need significant revision as time passes. It's just the nature of the business, and it's something every investor needs to understand when looking at insurance company financials."

The tricky part is that these numbers aren't concrete - they're estimates, and estimates by their very nature contain some degree of error. Now, what we and most other insurers do is apply statistical techniques to adjust these case reserves, creating what's called 'bulk' or 'supplemental' reserves. What we're aiming for is to get to a number that has an equal chance of being slightly too high or slightly too low when all is said and done. But I'll be completely frank with you - at Berkshire, even though we've added what we believed were appropriate supplemental reserves, they haven't been adequate in recent years. That's why I think it's crucial for our shareholders to understand the magnitude of these estimation errors.

These estimates, despite appearing in such precise-looking forms in the income statement, inevitably contain some degree of error. It's just the nature of the beast. That's why we've learned to take a longer-term view and why we're so transparent about showing you how our initial estimates compare to what we later discovered to be the reality.

But in casualty insurance, you might have a case where an employee develops a work-related illness decades after exposure. Those costs are much harder to predict. We've particularly underestimated what I call the 'deep pocket' phenomenon - the growing tendency of juries and courts to go after companies with substantial financial resources, regardless of the historical precedents or even the facts of the case. This has led to some embarrassing underestimating of our loss costs. It's particularly frustrating because these estimation errors don't just affect our reporting - they can lead to delayed responses in our business operations and even cause us to overpay taxes temporarily.

When we've had to make corrections that showed our underwriting results were actually worse than what we initially reported, it bothers me deeply. There are also practical implications that go beyond just the numbers on paper. When we don't have accurate figures, our insurance managers and I might not act with the urgency that the situation really demands. We're essentially making decisions based on incomplete information. Then there's the tax aspect - we've actually paid income taxes on earnings that were overstated.

Second, we didn't fully appreciate how contagious the publicity about huge awards would be on other juries.

This creates a real problem because external auditors can't effectively police these financial statements. The company itself has to essentially volunteer that it's in trouble - as I like to say, the corpse has to file its own death certificate. And you can imagine how often that happens! Some companies, when facing bad underwriting results, simply take an extraordinarily optimistic view about these yet-to-be-paid sums, while others engage in various transactions to hide true current loss costs.

These assessment systems force healthy insurers to cover the shortfalls of the failed ones. And because these companies have usually been misreporting their situations, the problems are typically much larger by the time they're discovered. What really concerns me is the potential for cascading failures in the industry. If several large insurers go under, the resulting guarantee fund assessments could push previously solvent but weaker insurers over the edge too. Now, state regulators could help by identifying and shutting down insolvent insurers more quickly, but I have to tell you, progress on that front has been disappointingly slow.

Now, let's compare that to what we see in operating businesses. To get similar after-tax earnings - about $22.7 million, or roughly $45 million pre-tax - in a typical business deal, we'd usually have to pay somewhere between $250-300 million, sometimes even more. That's because very few businesses can earn 16.3% after tax on unleveraged capital like our WPPSS investment does. And when you do find businesses with those economics, they typically sell at large premiums. Sure, we'll gladly pay those prices for businesses we really understand and like, but when we can get similar returns through a bond investment at a much lower price, that's certainly worth our attention.

Here's a simple example I like to use: if you take a 12% bond and reinvest all the coupon payments into more bonds, it'll grow just like a regular business that reinvests all its earnings. A $10 million investment growing at 12% will reach $300 million in 30 years, whether it's a bond or an operating business. The key difference is that with a bond, you know exactly what you're going to get - no more, no less. That's why it's crucial to think like a businessperson when buying bonds. Take what happened in 1946 - investors were buying 20-year AAA tax-exempt bonds yielding just 1%. That's like buying a business that can only earn 1% on book value and paying full price for it! Any businessman would laugh at that proposition, especially when you could buy excellent businesses earning 10%, 12%, or 15% after tax for about the same price.

Now, look at a regular business that starts with $10 million, earns 12% on equity, and retains all its earnings for growth - it also ends up with $300 million after 30 years. Both will be earning over $32 million in that final year. This parallel growth pattern tells us something important about long-term investment returns. When you retain and reinvest earnings - whether from bonds or a business - at a consistent rate of return, you get the same compounding effect. The critical difference is that with bonds, you're locked into that return rate. It's like having a business that can never earn a penny more than its initial yield. That's why we treat bonds as a special kind of business with very specific advantages and disadvantages.

But here's the key point - this approach only works because of our financial position.

It's like having a strong foundation that lets you build higher - our financial strength gives us options that others don't have. That's why Charlie and I can make these concentrated bets when we see real value, while it would be totally inappropriate for almost any other insurer to follow this same strategy."

We believe substantial inflation lies ahead, though I won't pretend to know the exact rate. What's particularly concerning is that there's a small, but not insignificant, chance of runaway inflation. Now, some might think this sounds absurd given recent lower inflation rates, but look at our present fiscal policy with its huge deficit - it's extremely dangerous and difficult to reverse. Politicians from both parties seem to be following Charlie Brown's advice: 'No problem is so big that it can't be run away from.' Without a major policy reversal, high rates of inflation may be delayed, perhaps for a long time, but they won't be avoided. And here's the key point - while stocks and bonds might perform similarly when inflation is in the 5%-10% range, runaway inflation is a completely different story.

I believe this is a crucial oversight because capital allocation is absolutely fundamental to both business and investment management. Here's what's really important to understand: all earnings are not created equal. Take businesses with high asset-to-profit ratios, for instance. In these cases, inflation can turn some or all of the reported earnings into what I call 'ersatz' or 'restricted' earnings. And here's the key point - these restricted earnings cannot be distributed as dividends if the business wants to maintain its economic position. That's why managers and owners need to think very carefully about when earnings should be retained and when they should be distributed. It's not just about having a policy - it's about understanding the economic reality behind that policy."

Restricted earnings are what I call the ersatz portion of reported earnings that, due to inflation, cannot be distributed as dividends if the business wants to maintain its economic position. You see, when a business has high asset-to-profit ratios, inflation forces them to retain these earnings just to stay in place. If they distributed these restricted earnings, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot in three critical ways: they couldn't maintain their unit volume of sales, they'd lose their competitive position, and their financial strength would deteriorate. I'll give you a real example of this - look at what happened with Consolidated Edison years ago. They were reinvesting earnings even though every dollar they put back into the business was only worth 25 cents in market value - talk about turning gold into lead! But they had to keep doing it. Their signs said 'Dig We Must,' and boy, they really meant it. The key thing to understand is that while these restricted earnings aren't worthless to owners, you often have to discount them heavily because they're essentially conscripted by the business, regardless of how poor the return might be."

Any company that consistently distributes restricted earnings is on a path to oblivion - and I don't use that word lightly - unless they can get equity capital from somewhere else. It's simple mathematics and business reality. You see, when inflation is eating away at your business, you need these earnings to maintain your competitive position and keep your business running at the same level. It's like trying to run up a down escalator - if you don't keep putting one foot in front of the other, you're going to end up at the bottom. No matter how conservative a company thinks it's being with its payout ratio, if it's distributing earnings that should be retained just to maintain its economic position, it's effectively consuming its seed corn. This isn't about being overly conservative - it's about survival. And this applies particularly to businesses with high asset-to-profit ratios, where inflation has an even bigger impact. The company has to retain these earnings even if the returns aren't attractive, because the alternative is worse - it's economic deterioration."

But I believe the principle is quite simple: management should choose whatever course makes the most sense for the owners. The key test is whether the retained capital can produce incremental earnings equal to or better than what investors could generally get elsewhere. If it can't meet that hurdle rate, those earnings should be distributed to shareholders. This isn't just theory - we want to see reasonable prospects backed by historical evidence or, when appropriate, a thoughtful analysis of the future. Too many managers retain earnings without meeting this fundamental test, and that's not serving their shareholders well."

This directly parallels our thinking about corporate retention of earnings. When a company can reinvest earnings at rates significantly above what shareholders could get elsewhere, retention makes sense. Just like in our bond example, where reinvesting at 10% when market rates are 5% creates obvious value, corporate reinvestment needs to clear a similar hurdle. The principle is the same - we're looking for situations where reinvestment creates more value than distribution.

If rates are at 5%, it would be foolish to take cash because those 10% bonds are worth a premium - you'd be leaving money on the table. The smart move would be to take more bonds and sell them if you need cash. But flip that around - if rates are at 15%, no rational investor would want their money reinvested at 10%. You'd take the cash and buy higher-yielding investments in the market. It's really just common sense - you want your money working at the highest available rate. The same principle applies when we think about companies retaining earnings versus paying dividends. Though I should note that with companies, it's trickier because you're not dealing with a contractual rate like our bond example - you're dealing with fluctuating returns on reinvested earnings. But the core concept remains: the decision to reinvest or distribute should be based on the returns available on reinvested capital."

So if you take your coupon in new bonds, you can immediately sell them for more than if you'd taken the cash directly. This is true for every rational investor - there's no scenario where taking the cash directly makes sense when rates are significantly below your bond's coupon rate. I used the 5% versus 10% example in our hypothetical case because it makes the math clear, but the principle holds true in any similar situation. The key is to think like a rational investor - don't let your immediate need for cash cloud your judgment about the most profitable way to get that cash. Take the reinvestment option, sell the bonds at their premium value, and you'll end up with more cash than if you'd taken the direct cash payment. It's really just a matter of taking the extra step to maximize your return."

If we're likely to earn low returns, we should pay them out to shareholders. Now, it's trickier than a bond analysis because we're dealing with fluctuating returns rather than contractual rates. You have to make an informed estimate about future returns. But I've noticed something interesting - many CEOs understand this concept perfectly when dealing with subsidiary companies. They'll readily tell Subsidiary A with 5% returns to distribute earnings so they can be invested in Subsidiary B earning 15%. That's good business thinking.

Instead of applying that same owner-oriented analysis, they'll blindly follow historical or industry-wide patterns, even if their track record shows they're only earning 5% on incremental capital while market rates are 10%. This makes no sense. If you're earning below-market returns, you should return that capital to shareholders who might find better opportunities elsewhere. The key principle here is consistency - managers should apply the same rational, return-based thinking at all levels of capital allocation.

That's great, but here's the catch: unless that business is growing like gangbusters, it's going to generate a lot of excess cash. Now, if management takes that excess cash and invests it in other businesses earning poor returns, the overall return might still look pretty good because the core business is so strong. It's just like our Pro-Am golf analogy - even if all the amateurs are terrible players, the team's best-ball score looks decent because of that one pro carrying the team.

Now, basic business logic would suggest they should return that capital to shareholders who could earn better returns elsewhere. But instead, what do they do? They often just default to whatever dividend policy is standard for their industry or whatever they've historically done. They're not following their own business school oath, so to speak.

The managers might be sinking substantial capital into low-return acquisitions or ventures, but because that core business keeps growing its earnings year after year, the overall returns still look impressive.

This increases the owners' interest in the exceptional business while sparing them participation in subpar ventures.

They'll periodically come back and report on the 'lessons they've learned' from their latest disappointment, only to go right back out and seek new lessons - failure seems to go to their heads, as I like to say.

This way, shareholders get to increase their stake in the exceptional businesses while avoiding further investment in the subpar ones. Now, I want to be clear - I'm not advocating for dividends that bounce around wildly every quarter based on short-term fluctuations. Shareholders prefer consistency and predictability in their dividend payments, and rightly so. What I am saying is that managers should be held accountable when they consistently take cash from high-return operations and plow it into ventures with poor returns. The dividend policy should reflect long-term expectations for both earnings and returns on incremental capital.

If we ever reach a point where we don't think we can clear that hurdle of creating sufficient value from retained earnings, we'll distribute all unrestricted earnings that we don't think we can use effectively. Right now, we see good opportunities, particularly in our insurance operations where many competitors are in weakened positions. The industry is poised for substantial premium-volume gains - we're looking at over $15 billion in 1985 compared to less than $5 billion in 1983. While there are no guarantees, these circumstances could generate significant profitable business for us. The prospects are better than they've been in many years."

But let me be completely candid here: our future returns from these efforts will undoubtedly be lower than our historical returns. That's just the reality we face. We're still finding opportunities - like the potential business that shareholder John Loomis identified in 1984, which met all our criteria though it didn't quite work out due to a chance complication. But we're realistic about returns. The key is that we're not just diversifying for diversification's sake. We're looking for opportunities where we can deploy capital effectively, particularly in areas like our insurance operations where we see significant potential for growth. The industry dynamics right now are creating some interesting possibilities, especially with many competitors in weakened financial positions. So while returns may be lower than our historical performance, we still see paths to creating substantial value through thoughtful diversification and expansion."

First, we want businesses with at least $5 million in after-tax earnings - we're looking for substantial operations. But more importantly, we insist on demonstrated consistent earning power. You see, we have little interest in future projections or turnaround situations. I always say that if there's lots of technology involved, we won't understand it, and we don't invest in things we don't understand. We want businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt - that's crucial. And we need management in place because we can't supply it ourselves. We're not interested in hostile takeovers - never have been, never will be. We want willing sellers who understand our approach. What's particularly important is that we can give a very fast answer, usually within five minutes, about whether we're interested. We don't want to waste anyone's time, including our own, which is why we require an offering price upfront. For the right business and the right people, we can provide a good home. It's really that simple - we stick to what we understand and look for proven performance rather than promises."

We're very transparent about our approach - we won't engage in unfriendly takeovers, and we encourage potential sellers to do their homework on us. In fact, we invite them to contact people we've done business with in the past. We don't want any surprises on either side. One thing we're very clear about is that we need an offering price upfront. We don't want to waste time talking about a transaction when the price is unknown - that doesn't serve anyone's interests. Look at what happened with John Loomis's lead in 1984 - we found a company that met all our tests and immediately pursued it, though a chance complication prevented the deal. That's how we operate - when we see something good, we move quickly and decisively."

We're actually asking shareholders to vote on whether to continue it and at what per-share level - something that's pretty much unheard of in corporate America. In fact, we couldn't find a single other example of management asking shareholders for their opinion on owner-related policies like this. You know, it's kind of ironic - many managers who claim to believe in capitalism seem pretty reluctant to trust actual capitalists with these decisions. But we think it's important that shareholders have a say, which is why we're putting it to an advisory vote. One critical point for new shareholders though: if you want to participate in future programs, you need to make sure your shares are registered in your actual name, not in 'street' or nominee name. If they're not properly registered by September 30, 1985, you won't be eligible for that year's program."

First, you've got some management teams who just won't open up about substantive business matters. But more often, the problem actually comes from the shareholder side. You see, some participants are more interested in having their moment in the spotlight than discussing actual corporate affairs. It's like getting a bargain that's too good to pass up - for the price of just one share, you get a captive audience to tell your views on how the world should be run. Instead of having a productive forum for business discussion, these meetings can turn into a stage for theatrics, spleen-venting, and advocating for various issues that aren't really relevant to the company's business. That's not what these meetings should be about. When we hold our annual meeting in Omaha on May 21, 1985, we aim to have real, substantive discussions about business matters that actually matter to our company and shareholders."

At many companies, annual meetings have unfortunately devolved into what I'd call theatrical performances - people buying a single share just to get a platform for their personal agendas or to vent their frustrations. That's not what these meetings should be about. At Berkshire, we've cultivated something entirely different. Our attendance grows steadily each year because we focus on substantive business discussions. We've never had a silly question or someone grandstanding for personal attention. Instead, we get thoughtful, business-focused questions, and Charlie and I are happy to spend whatever time it takes to answer them properly. Now, we do have some limits - we won't discuss anything that could cost our company money, particularly our securities activities. But otherwise, it's an open forum for real business discussion. This approach has helped us attract and retain the kind of shareholders we want - partners who are genuinely interested in understanding and growing our business rather than pushing personal agendas."

While we're happy to spend hours answering questions at the meeting, we simply can't do one-on-one reporting throughout the year. With 3000 shareholders, it would be a poor use of management time to handle individual phone calls or written questions as they come in. Think about it - if we tried to give individual attention to every shareholder question throughout the year, we'd spend more time reporting on the business than running it. That's why we've structured our communication this way: comprehensive annual meetings where nothing is off limits (except where candor might cost us money), detailed annual reports, and a focused approach to management time. We've always taken pride in the quality of our shareholder-partners, and this system has served both us and them well. It's part of building the kind of business relationship we want with our shareholders - one that's based on mutual understanding and respect for everyone's time and resources."
