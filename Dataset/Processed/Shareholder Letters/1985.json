Back then, our biggest challenge was simply deciding which bargain to choose - there were plenty of significantly undervalued equities available. Today, we're looking at a complete reversal - what I'd call 180 degrees removed from that environment. We simply cannot find significantly-undervalued equities to purchase for our insurance company portfolios. This shift has important implications not just for new investments, but also for our existing portfolio. You see, in 1974, I could confidently say we had major holdings with great potential for significantly increased values. But the current market offers very little opportunity compared to what we saw throughout much of the 1964-1984 period. This is one of the key factors that makes our historical growth rates unachievable going forward. It's just the reality of the market we're dealing with now."

I made the observation that this coincided with Halley's Comet, and I believe neither that percentage gain nor the comet will be seen again in my lifetime. That's not just modesty talking. Looking at our longer-term performance, we've grown our per-share book value from $19.46 to $1643.71 over twenty-one years, which works out to 23.2% compounded annually. But here's the key point - these kinds of returns simply aren't repeatable. Our strategy of staying patient until something big popped up worked well in 1985, leading to several significant moves including our purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, acquiring Scott & Fetzer, our insurance deal with Fireman's Fund, and the sale of our General Foods stock. But the market environment has changed dramatically. When you combine that with our much larger capital base, it becomes clear that these historical growth rates are now out of reach. It's important for shareholders to understand this reality."

But here's the reality - once companies amass significant equity capital, say $1 billion or more, maintaining those exceptional returns becomes increasingly difficult. I've studied this extensively, and I can tell you that I don't know of any company that has managed to keep earning 20% or more on equity while reinvesting all or substantially all of its earnings over a ten-year period after reaching that size. The math simply works against you. These companies typically end up having to shed capital through dividends or stock repurchases because they can't find enough high-return opportunities to reinvest all their earnings. Now, would shareholders have been better off if these companies could reinvest all earnings at those fat returns? Absolutely. But that's just not how it works in practice. It's a simple matter of scale - the bigger you get, the harder it is to find enough attractive opportunities to move the needle. We face this same challenge at Berkshire. When I mentioned we needed profits of $3.9 billion over ten years to earn 15% annually, that illustrates exactly how size impacts our ability to generate the exceptional returns we once did."

Back in our 1974 annual report, I could confidently say we had several major holdings with great potential for significantly increased values. Today, while we still hold positions in companies with exceptional underlying economics and outstanding managements - just like we did in 1974 - there's a crucial difference. The market is now generously appraising these qualities, whereas in 1974, they were largely ignored. This has profound implications for our future returns. Let me be direct: our insurance companies have no chance for future portfolio gains on the scale of those achieved in the past. It's simply a matter of market reality. When you're buying great businesses at generous valuations rather than ignored valuations, your potential for outsized returns is naturally limited. This change in market dynamics, combined with our much larger size, creates a double challenge for us. The opportunities for significant appreciation just aren't there like they were when markets were ignoring quality businesses. I have to be honest about this - it's a fundamental shift in our investment landscape, and it directly affects what our shareholders should expect in terms of future returns."

That's a 48% increase from the $3.9 billion figure I mentioned last year, which directly corresponds to our capital base growth. To give you a sense of just how substantial this goal is - excluding oil companies, only about 15 U.S. businesses have managed to earn over $5.7 billion in the past decade. While Charlie and I remain reasonably optimistic about our ability to outperform corporate America, we're going to need considerably more good fortune than what was required for our past 23.2% returns. It's simple mathematics - as our capital base grows, generating the same percentage returns becomes increasingly challenging. That's why I always say their problem is our problem. The bigger we get, the harder it becomes to maintain those historical growth rates."

We can focus entirely on maximizing long-term value without worrying about short-term market reactions or quarterly numbers. Second, we have tremendous flexibility in where we can invest and expand. We're not confined by history, structure, or concept - if we see an opportunity that makes sense, we can pursue it. And third - and this might sound simple but it's incredibly important - Charlie and I genuinely love what we do. When you combine these three factors, it creates a powerful foundation for long-term success. However, I should note that while these advantages are significant, they don't guarantee our targeted returns. As I mentioned in my earlier comments about needing $5.7 billion in profits over the next decade, we'll still need a healthy dose of good fortune to achieve our goals. But these structural advantages do give us a fighting chance at continuing to deliver superior returns."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, historically, Berkshire shares have traded at a modest discount to intrinsic business value, which was actually a good thing for new investors. When you buy at a discount, you can be pretty certain your investment returns will at least match the business's performance, assuming that discount doesn't widen. But lately, we've seen that discount disappear and sometimes even flip to a premium. Now, while that's wonderful for existing shareholders who benefited from this shift, it creates a more challenging situation for new investors. Let me be clear about this - if you're paying a premium over intrinsic value, that premium needs to be maintained just for you to match the business results going forward. You see, I've always preferred having our market price track closely with business value. When that happens, all owners prosper in direct proportion to how the business performs during their ownership period. While we can't control market prices directly, we try through our disclosures and policies to encourage rational market behavior. The key thing to understand is that while wild price swings don't change the total gains for all owners combined - as investor gains must ultimately equal business gains - they can create very different results for individual investors depending on their timing. It's like a game of musical chairs where your results depend heavily on when you happen to sit down."

The fundamental reality is that over the long term, investor gains in aggregate must equal business gains - that's just mathematical truth. However, when you have long periods where market prices swing substantially above or below business value, it creates an inequitable distribution of those business gains among different shareholders. Think about it this way: if you have two investors, and one buys during a period of significant undervaluation while another buys during overvaluation, they're going to experience very different investment results even though the underlying business performance remains the same for both. Whether an individual owner does well or poorly becomes largely a matter of whether they were lucky, shrewd, or foolish in their timing. That's why I've always emphasized the importance of having market prices that consistently approximate business value. When we have that situation, everyone's returns match the business performance during their specific period of ownership. It's the fairest outcome for all shareholders. But we can't control market prices - we can only try to encourage rational behavior through our transparent disclosures and consistent policies. The reality is that these price disconnections from value can persist for surprisingly long periods, creating quite different outcomes for different shareholders."

You see, when you have wild swings in market prices that go far above and below business value for long periods, some investors are going to do much better than others based on when they buy and sell. It really comes down to whether an investor is lucky, shrewd, or foolish in their timing. This is why I'm so proud of what we've achieved at Berkshire. We've maintained a more consistent relationship between market value and business value than any other publicly-traded company I know of. That's not because of anything special I did - it's because we have rational, long-term oriented shareholders who understand business value. They don't get caught up in the wild swings that affect other stocks. When you have investors focused on business fundamentals rather than market psychology, you tend to get more sensible pricing and more equitable distribution of returns over time."

But the reality is quite different. What we've observed is that stocks that are heavily owned and constantly monitored by institutions have often been among the most inappropriately valued. At Berkshire, we've actually benefited from having almost all individual shareholders rather than institutions - something unique for a company our size. The reason institutional investors often act irrationally despite their resources reminds me of the Ben Graham story about the oil prospector at heaven's gates. The point is that professional investors often act in ways that seem to contradict their supposed expertise and sophistication. This is partly because they're responding to short-term pressures and incentives that don't necessarily align with rational valuation. They're more focused on relative performance and quarterly results than on fundamental business value. That's why we prefer our shareholder base of individuals who think like business owners rather than traders."

You see, just like those oil men who rushed out of heaven based on a mere rumor, investment professionals often exhibit this remarkable tendency to follow the crowd, even when it might lead them somewhere less desirable - like hell in our story! The key insight here is that even the prospector himself, who knew he had made up the rumor, ended up following the crowd because he thought there might be some truth to his own fiction. This is exactly what we see in the investment world. Professionals often chase after investment trends not because they've done their own careful analysis, but because they're afraid of missing out on what everyone else is doing. They'd rather be wrong conventionally than right unconventionally. It's a pattern that's been repeating itself in markets for as long as I've been investing, and Ben Graham recognized this human nature aspect of investing long before many others did."

Let me be very clear about this - we don't even prepare consolidated figures for internal use because they simply don't help us manage or evaluate our businesses effectively. Now, what's interesting is that corporate managers have always demanded detailed segment information when they're making acquisition decisions. But historically, these same managers would turn around and deny this same vital information to their own shareholders. They'd hide behind this notion that sharing detailed segment data would somehow hurt the company - which I find to be a rather convenient excuse. The reality is that investors need this information to make intelligent decisions about buying or selling shares, just as managers need it to make acquisition decisions. It's that simple. We believe in giving our shareholders the same level of information that we ourselves use to evaluate our businesses. That's why we break down our earnings by major sources and provide detailed sub-segment numbers.

Think about it - at graduation, you're recognizing four years of accumulated knowledge on a single day when no actual new learning is taking place. Similarly, when we report large security gains, we're often just recognizing value that was built up over many years prior. In 1985, for instance, we had unusually large earnings from security sales, but I wouldn't want anyone to conclude that this alone made it a particularly successful year. The key is to understand that these gains represent the harvesting of value created over time, not necessarily value created within that specific reporting period.

Take our insurance operations - while we had an underwriting loss that year, we generated significant investment income, which is a key part of our insurance strategy. Or look at See's Candies and Buffalo News - both showing strong, consistent earnings. What's important to understand is that we're not just buying stocks - we're buying businesses. Some will have better years than others - you can see that in the numbers - but what matters is the overall operating earnings power of our collection of businesses.

We might hold a stock for 10 years or more, and during that entire period, the business value and market value might grow quite consistently. But here's the key point - in the year we finally sell it, there might be no increase in value at all, or maybe even a decrease. However, all the growth in value since we first bought it gets reflected in our accounting earnings in that final year of sale. That's why looking at realized gains in any single year really tells you nothing about how well we've done in that particular year. It's the long-term accumulation of value that matters, not when we happen to realize it. Now, there is one exception - if the stock is held in our insurance subsidiaries, any changes in market value show up in our net worth annually.

Second, we identified a business with excellent underlying economics. Third, and this is crucial, we had able management in place - Jim Ferguson and Phil Smith - who concentrated on shareholders' interests and worked to increase the business value year after year. Finally, we had a buyer, Philip Morris, who was willing to pay full business value when they made their offer. This combination resulted in a substantial pre-tax gain of $338 million when we sold in 1985. It's a perfect example of our investment approach: finding undervalued businesses with strong fundamentals, managed by capable people who are focused on creating shareholder value, and then being patient until the market recognizes that value.

The key thing we look for is whether the repurchase price is below the intrinsic business value. When that's the case, the non-selling shareholders actually benefit, since they're all given the same opportunity we are. Now, there are some tax advantages for us as a corporate entity, since we pay lower taxes on dividend income than on capital gains. But we won't let tax benefits drive our decision-making. What's crucial is that we only sell to the extent that our proportional ownership stake remains unchanged. Think of it like this: if we own 10% of a business, we might sell enough shares to maintain that 10% ownership while getting some cash out. The IRS views this as essentially equivalent to a dividend, and they're right - we're receiving cash while keeping our ownership percentage intact.

Let me give you the stark numbers: in the previous nine years, the company had sales of $530 million but produced a loss of $10 million. It was a case of one step forward, two steps back. Even though profits would show up occasionally, the fundamental economics weren't there. At the time, many people thought southern textile plants had competitive advantages because they were non-union, and most northern operations had already shut down.

We reduced investment in inventories, receivables, and fixed assets, which proved to be a wise decision.

We were quite methodical about this transformation. The money came from two sources: the earnings the business was generating, plus what we freed up by reducing our investment in textile inventories, receivables, and fixed assets. This pullback from textile assets proved to be a wise decision. You see, even though we had excellent management under Ken Chace - and he really was excellent - the fundamental economics of the textile business never improved to our satisfaction. It simply never became a good earner, even during industry upturns. But by gradually diversifying and reallocating capital to more promising opportunities, we were able to reduce the textile operation's negative impact on our overall returns as it became a progressively smaller portion of Berkshire.

And fourth - and this is where I made a significant mistake - I believed the business would generate modest but positive cash returns relative to investment. I laid all this out in our 1978 annual report and stood by it. But you see, that fourth assumption proved to be completely wrong. After 1979, instead of modest returns, we saw major cash consumption. By mid-1985, I had to face reality - this wasn't a temporary situation but a permanent condition. I would have preferred selling to someone who'd keep operations running, but the same economics that finally became clear to me were obvious to potential buyers. Sometimes in business, you have to admit when your initial assessment was wrong, even when you've publicly stated otherwise. That's what happened here."

These overseas competitors had workers being paid just a small fraction of the U.S. minimum wage. That created both direct and indirect competitive pressures that we simply couldn't overcome. When you're selling a commodity product - which is what textiles are - and your competition has dramatically lower labor costs, you're swimming upstream against a very strong current. This wasn't some temporary situation either; it was a structural change in the industry. That's why we saw 250 textile mills close since 1980. They were all facing these same fundamental challenges.

What's particularly interesting - and this is something I want to emphasize - is that this wasn't a case of having poor labor relations or unreasonable unions. In fact, our workers and union leaders were quite reasonable and worked hard to keep us competitive. The real issue was structural. We kept looking at opportunities to make capital expenditures that promised to reduce our variable costs. On paper, using standard return-on-investment calculations, these investments actually looked better than opportunities in our successful candy and newspaper businesses. But here's the key point - those promised benefits were illusory. In a commodity business with persistent excess capacity, any theoretical cost advantages tend to get competed away. It's like running on a treadmill - you can keep making investments to stay competitive, but you're not really getting anywhere. That's why I now strongly prefer businesses with sustainable competitive advantages rather than commodity operations, no matter how attractive the immediate cost-saving opportunities might appear."

In fact - and here's the ironic part that I find particularly interesting - we would have been financially better off if the union had been unreasonable years earlier. If they had made impossible demands, we would have been forced to face reality sooner and close the operation before accumulating significant losses. Instead, their reasonable behavior allowed us to continue longer than we should have, which ultimately led to larger cumulative losses. It's a fascinating example of how good intentions and cooperative behavior don't always lead to the best financial outcome. The workers performed admirably right through the liquidation period, but their very reasonableness helped mask the fundamental problems with the business.

But when everyone stands on their tiptoes, nobody sees any better, and everyone's just more uncomfortable. In the textile industry, each round of investment left all of us with more capital at stake but the same anemic returns. The cost reductions we achieved just became the new baseline for industry pricing.

But then looking at the other option, if we didn't invest, we knew we'd become increasingly non-competitive, even compared to other domestic manufacturers. I found myself relating to that Woody Allen movie quote where mankind faces a crossroads - one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction. That's exactly how it felt. We were choosing between two bad options: invest heavily for poor returns, or don't invest and watch the business slowly fail. Neither path offered a good outcome.

Here was a company that in 1964 was the undisputed leader in U.S. textiles - $1.2 billion in sales compared to our modest $50 million at Berkshire's textile operations. They had everything going for them - superior distribution, excellent production capabilities, and a much better earnings record than ours. They made what seemed like rational decisions, investing $3 billion in capital expenditures over two decades, mostly for cost improvements and expansion. But here's the key point - despite doing everything 'right' on paper, by 1985 their returns on sales and equity were far lower than 20 years prior. The stock, adjusted for splits, was barely above its 1964 price while inflation had tripled. What this tells us is that in a commodity business, even massive capital investments often can't overcome the fundamental economics of the industry. You can be the biggest, the most efficient, make entirely rational decisions - and still not create real value for shareholders if the underlying business economics are poor. That's why I've learned to be extremely cautious about capital-intensive commodity businesses, no matter how well-managed they appear to be."

After a 2-for-1 split in 1965 and two decades of operations, it was selling at $34 in 1985. Now, that might not sound terrible on the surface, but here's the critical part - during this period, the Consumer Price Index more than tripled. This means each share in 1985 commanded only about one-third of the purchasing power it did in 1964. Even the dividends, while paid regularly, significantly lost purchasing power over time. What we're seeing here is that nominal prices can be deceiving - you have to look at real returns after inflation. Burlington's shareholders essentially lost two-thirds of their real value over 20 years, despite the company investing $3 billion in capital expenditures, or more than $200 per share on that original $60 stock. This demonstrates a fundamental principle: in businesses with poor economics, inflation can be particularly cruel to investors. Even maintaining your nominal position can mean losing substantial real value over time. That's why I've always emphasized the importance of investing in businesses that have the pricing power and economic characteristics to create real value above inflation over the long term."

Consider the facts: despite having significant assets on the books, our textile shares lost about two-thirds of their purchasing power over time. Regular dividends were paid, but even those shrank significantly in real terms. This devastating outcome for shareholders happened even though we applied considerable brain power and energy to the business. What this taught me is that you can't just look at static measures like book value or even what some economists and academicians consider important, like replacement values for the overall market.

Yet when we tried to sell it, we couldn't even give it away - we literally got less than zero after accounting for sale costs. Those modern looms we bought for $5,000 each in 1981? We had to practically pay people to haul them away as scrap for $26. The key lesson here is that assets are only worth what they can earn, not what you paid for them or what they'd cost to replace. To put this in perspective, a couple of paper routes in Buffalo or one See's candy store - businesses with real earning power - are worth far more than this massive collection of textile equipment that once employed 1,000 people. This is why I now focus on economic goodwill and earning power rather than getting too excited about tangible assets on the balance sheet.

But when the competitive position of the American textile industry changed, these same assets became practically worthless. We couldn't even get $50 for looms that we'd bought for $5,000 just a few years earlier. Compare that to something like a See's candy store, which has a strong competitive position in its market. The economic goodwill of just one store exceeds what we got for this entire textile operation. This demonstrates how the competitive position of a business can completely transform the value of its assets. When you're in a tough competitive position, even expensive, well-maintained assets can become worthless. But when you have a strong competitive moat, even a small operation can generate significant value.

It's like sitting in your rocking chair and quadrupling your savings account balance - sure, you'll get four times the interest, but does that make you a financial genius?

Let me be clear - if a company has to retain large amounts of earnings and plow them back into the business just to grow, that's not necessarily skillful management. Think about it this way - anyone can quadruple their earnings from a savings account by simply quadrupling the capital they put in. We wouldn't throw a parade for that achievement, would we? What really matters is the relationship between additional capital required and earnings growth. In our businesses, we've demonstrated the ability to grow earnings substantially while requiring relatively minimal additional capital.

If the company earned superior returns on capital and only doubled the capital employed while quadrupling earnings, then yes, that CEO probably deserves some praise. But if they just plowed back earnings year after year and achieved mediocre returns, well, that's nothing special at all. I mean, you could get the same result from a basic savings account compounding at 8% - it would quadruple its earnings in 18 years just by reinvesting the interest. The math is really quite simple, but many companies conveniently ignore this when designing compensation plans.

This trustee gets to decide how much of the interest you receive in cash and how much gets reinvested. Now, the reinvested portion - the retained earnings - will naturally compound and grow the account. But would you lavishly reward that trustee for the growth that comes simply from reinvesting your money? Of course not! Yet this is exactly what many corporate compensation plans do. They're especially problematic when companies pay out only small dividends while retaining most earnings, and then grant these long-term stock options. The managers are essentially getting rewarded for withholding shareholders' earnings and letting them compound - something that would happen automatically in a simple savings account.

Because by simply holding back earnings - not necessarily investing them well, mind you - they can watch the value of their options increase. A clever manager, particularly one who's both 'Machiavellian and a bit of a mathematician,' might even reduce dividend payouts once they're established in their position. They profit at the shareholders' expense simply by sitting on the money. This isn't just theoretical - I've seen many corporate stock options work exactly this way. They've gained value not because management did well with the capital, but simply because they retained earnings.

What's particularly interesting is the double standard at play here. You won't find any business in the world granting ten-year fixed-price options to outsiders, especially not on a business that's regularly adding to its capital. If an outsider wanted such an option, they'd have to pay fully for any capital added during the option period. But somehow, when managers are negotiating with themselves - and as I like to say, negotiating with oneself seldom produces a barroom brawl - they're perfectly happy to engineer ten-year, fixed-price options that completely ignore both the automatic build-up of value from retained earnings and the carrying cost of capital.

The key distinction here isn't about whether stock options should exist as a form of compensation - they should.

The problem isn't with rewarding great managers; it's with the current standard practice of granting ten-year, fixed-price options that don't account for the automatic build-up of value through retained earnings. We need to distinguish between rewarding actual value creation versus simply riding the wave of accumulated capital.

It's like having a Rip Van Winkle in management who could sleep for ten years and still collect. That's not exactly what I'd call an incentive system that makes sense for shareholders."

They actually argued that the payoff was far greater than intended and made quite a fuss about it in the national news. Now, here's what I find particularly interesting - and I've been watching this stuff for quite a while - I've never seen a single case where managers anywhere have expressed similar concerns about excessive option payoffs when they or their colleagues were the beneficiaries. Not once. It's a perfect example of how perspective changes depending on which side of the option you're on. When executives are receiving outsized option payoffs themselves, that anguish about fairness and proportional rewards seems to completely disappear. It's human nature, but it's also quite revealing about how options are viewed differently when you're giving versus receiving."

You've got to weigh the upside potential against real downside risk. But an option holder? They're in a completely different boat. They have no capital costs and no downside risk at all. It's like getting a free lottery ticket - which, by the way, I'd be happy to accept as a gift, but I'll never buy one. This creates a misalignment of interests, particularly when it comes to dividend policy. Think about a savings account scenario: an option-holding manager would prefer no dividends to maximize their potential gain, while the actual owner might want a total payout to prevent the manager from benefiting from retained earnings. This is why I often say that the very projects where you'd most want to have an option are frequently the ones where you'd reject ownership entirely. It's crucial to understand these differences because they fundamentally change how people behave and make decisions."

The key principle here is that stock options should only be awarded to managers with overall responsibility for the corporation's performance, since they're inevitably tied to overall corporate results. Let me use a baseball analogy to make this clear: Think of a .350 hitter - they deserve a big payoff for their performance even if they're playing for a last-place team. Conversely, a .150 hitter shouldn't get rewarded just because they're on a pennant-winning team. The same principle applies in business - managers with limited areas of responsibility should have incentives that pay off based on results under their direct control, not the broader company performance. It's about matching the reward to the sphere of influence. If you're running the whole team, then yes, your rewards should be tied to the team's results. But if you're responsible for just one department or division, your incentives should reflect that specific scope of responsibility."

But then, curiously, they're perfectly happy to use these same 'depressed' prices when they're buying portions of the business for themselves through options. Some even go hunting through the Tax Code to find the absolute lowest prices they can justify. I find this troubling because owners are rarely well-served by selling part of their business at bargain prices - whether that sale is to outsiders or insiders. It's really that simple. Now, I should note that some managers I greatly admire disagree with me on fixed-price options. They've built successful corporate cultures where options have been a useful tool. When such a culture exists and is working well, maybe it should be left alone despite some inefficiencies. But as a general principle, I believe proper pricing is crucial for aligning interests correctly. Anything else is essentially giving away company value at a discount."

When we structure options, they need to be done carefully. They should have built-in factors for retained earnings or carrying costs. But beyond just the technical structure, we need to think about what we're really incentivizing. Are we rewarding individual performance or just letting everyone benefit from overall company success they may not have contributed to? That's why I emphasize that options and rewards need to be tied to actual responsibility and contribution. Think of it like a baseball team - you wouldn't give a poor-performing player a bonus just because the team won the pennant. The same principle applies in business. We want to reward those who have genuine responsibility for and impact on overall results, not just anyone who happens to be on the team."

What's really important is that we define performance differently for different businesses, because let's face it - some of our managers are operating with tailwinds that make their job easier, while others are fighting headwinds every day. The rewards can be substantial - some managers might get bonuses of five times their base salary or even more. We don't believe in caps on bonuses, and we don't care about hierarchy. If you're running a smaller unit and doing an outstanding job, you might earn more than someone running a larger unit. That's perfectly fine with us.

Even if there are some inefficiencies or inequities in the option program, I'm a believer in 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' rather than demanding 'purity at any price.' You see, creating a culture where everyone thinks like an owner is incredibly rare and valuable. When you find it, you need to think very carefully before making changes that might disrupt it. Now, at Berkshire, we've chosen a different path with our unit-based incentive system, but I recognize there isn't just one right way to do things.

Second, managers invariably rush to add capacity when things start looking up and capital becomes available. You see, insurance is just like any other commodity in a free market. In the past, we had what amounted to a cartel-like arrangement that kept prices up, but those days are gone forever. Now, insurance follows the basic laws of supply and demand - when capacity is tight, prices will be remunerative; when it isn't, they won't be. The interesting thing about insurance, though, is that capacity isn't a physical limitation like it would be in, say, the aluminum or steel industry. It's more of an attitudinal thing - insurance managers can write as much business as they feel comfortable writing, subject only to regulatory oversight and Best's ratings. And that comfort level is directly tied to capital - more capital means more comfort, which leads to more capacity. So when profits improve, capital flows in, capacity expands, and the cycle begins anew."

You need to build plants, install equipment, that sort of thing. But in insurance, capacity is what I'd call an attitudinal concept rather than a physical fact. It's really quite fascinating when you think about it. Insurance managers have the ability to write whatever amount of business they feel comfortable writing. The only real constraints are the pressures applied by regulators and Best's, which is our industry's authoritative rating service. What actually determines capacity is the comfort level of both managers and regulators, and that comfort level is directly tied to capital. It's a simple equation really - more capital creates more comfort, which in turn creates more capacity. This is why you can see insurance capacity expand much more quickly than in traditional commodity businesses. There's no need to build factories or install heavy machinery - it's largely a matter of having capital and the willingness to deploy it."

But in insurance, capital can be raised almost instantly, and that's exactly what we saw happening in 1985 when about 15 insurers raised over $3 billion. The problem is that this quick capital raising leads to a predictable cycle. When prices are good, everyone rushes to raise capital to write more business. This floods the market with capacity, which inevitably leads to price-cutting, and then profitability falls. It's similar to what we saw in our textile business - each company makes decisions that seem sensible for themselves, but collectively these decisions end up destroying profitability for everyone. The dynamics of capitalism make this pattern almost inevitable. That's why at Berkshire, we've always focused on maintaining unusual financial strength through thick and thin, which gives us a competitive advantage when the market tightens and there's a flight to quality."

Insurance policies are really just IOUs, and in 1985, many large buyers of insurance and reinsurance learned this the hard way when they couldn't collect on many of their IOUs. This triggered what we correctly anticipated would be a flight to quality. Our financial strength, and more importantly our track record of maintaining that strength through thick and thin, became a major asset in securing good business.

We've maintained unusual financial strength through thick and thin, and that's become a major asset for us.

Instead, they use what we call excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. Here's how it works: the issuing company might only keep the first $1 million of any loss, while passing on the remaining $24 million to their reinsurers. In the industry, we say these companies write a large gross line but a small net line. Think of it like a sandwich - the issuing company takes a small bite, but passes most of it along to others. One of the tricky parts in these arrangements is determining how to split up the premiums among these different layers of risk. It's a bit like slicing up that sandwich and deciding what each piece is worth.

But now we're facing an even bigger challenge - the courts are making unprecedented awards that simply don't follow historical patterns. When you're trying to price risk based on past experience, but the future isn't following any historical pattern, you're essentially flying blind. As I like to say, we've moved from Patrick Henry to Pogo: 'The future ain't what it used to be.' This creates a fundamental pricing problem in our industry.

They've been able to retain a much larger percentage of the premiums than the actual risk they're taking. This has happened for two main reasons. First, we've seen growing uncertainties in the business, particularly with these unpredictable court awards I mentioned. Second, we've had an influx of what I'd call 'unsophisticated participants' into the reinsurance market. When you combine these factors, the companies writing small net lines have been able to keep a disproportionate share of the premiums compared to the risk they're actually retaining.

That's exactly how we think about our investments. When we see a great business with first-class management, like Cap Cities, we're willing to wait while the long-term value proposition plays out. We're not looking for immediate excitement or quick profits. What matters is the quality of the business and management, not the short-term results. This is why we structured our agreement with Tom as CEO to vote our stock - it shows our commitment to the long-term vision. We're backing great managers and giving them the time and space they need to build value. That's how real wealth is created in business."

In today's market, when you have widely-diffused ownership of voting stock, you're always at risk of having some major holder surface who might shake things up. These 'revolving-door capitalists' often come in talking a good game but frequently have what I'd call uncivil intentions. That's why at Berkshire, we deliberately structure our stock ownership to promote stability where it might otherwise be lacking. You see, when you combine that kind of certainty with a good manager and a good business, you've got excellent soil for a rich financial harvest. That's the economic case. But there's also an important human element here. When we find managers we like and admire - folks who've welcomed our major financial commitment - we don't want them losing sleep wondering if we might surprise them with some unwanted action because of our large ownership position. I tell them there will be no surprises, and we put that in writing. It's Berkshire's signature backing up my word, which means they have a corporate commitment that extends beyond my personal involvement."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Let me be direct about this - as we saw with our Cap Cities purchase, we paid what I'd call a full price. And that reflects something important about market dynamics that investors need to understand. When you're dealing with sectors that have captured market enthusiasm - like media stocks and media properties in this case - prices tend to reflect that enthusiasm. Sometimes, particularly with property purchases, this enthusiasm can approach what I'd call a mania. Now, this doesn't mean we won't make purchases at full prices, but we're very careful about it. What we look for is the combination of factors that can justify that price - stable ownership structure, excellent management, and strong business fundamentals. But I want to be crystal clear: we're not in the business of paying up just because a sector is hot. When we do pay full price, it's because we see fundamental value that justifies that price, even if we have to pay up due to market conditions."

We don't employ corporate planners to give us fancy insights about socioeconomic trends, and we don't have a staff dedicated to investigating the countless ideas that come from promoters and intermediaries. Our approach is actually quite simple: we wait for something sensible to come along, and when it does, we act. Take our Scott Fetzer purchase - that's a perfect example of how we operate. We're not trying to overthink things or create complicated frameworks. What we are doing is staying ready and keeping our criteria clear. We want businesses with demonstrated consistent earning power - and I emphasize demonstrated because future projections don't interest us much. We want simple businesses we can understand, good returns on equity without much debt, and existing management in place. When something matching these criteria comes along at the right price, we can move very quickly - usually within five minutes we can tell you if we're interested. It's not sophisticated, but it works for us."

This minimum is important because we need any acquisition to have a measurable impact on Berkshire's financial results. Second, we insist on demonstrated consistent earning power. Notice I say 'demonstrated' - we're not interested in future projections or turnaround situations. Third, we look for businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt. Fourth, we need management in place because, frankly, we can't supply it ourselves. Fifth, we stick to simple businesses - if there's lots of technology involved, we won't understand it, so we stay away. And finally, we need an offering price upfront. We don't want to waste anyone's time talking about deals without knowing the price. Now, we'll pay in cash, though we might consider stock if we receive as much in intrinsic business value as we give. One thing I want to emphasize - we absolutely will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. That's just not how we operate. When we find something that meets these criteria, we can move very quickly and with complete confidentiality."

        "value": "Well, I've always believed in using the simplest, most straightforward approach to solve complex problems. In the Rockford case, we went back to what might be the oldest fair division principle in the world - the same one many of us learned as children with cake-cutting. You know, where one person cuts and the other chooses. When we needed to dispose of our Illinois National Bank holdings, I essentially acted as the cutter, setting up the exchange ratio between Rockford and Berkshire shares. Then our shareholders got first choice, deciding how much they wanted to exchange, if any. I took whatever was left over. The beauty of this system is its inherent fairness - the person cutting has to be fair because they don't know which piece they'll end up with. And looking at the results five years later when Illinois National was sold, the Rockford shareholders received proceeds about equal to Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value at the time of the sale. That outcome validated our approach - it showed we had managed to cut the cake pretty fairly. Sometimes the old, simple solutions are still the best ones."

Last year, we had over 250 shareholders show up out of our more than 3,000 registered owners, and what really stands out is the quality of engagement we see. Our shareholders ask the kinds of questions you'd expect from people who think like owners - intelligent, thoughtful questions that show they're genuinely interested in understanding the business. I've been to plenty of annual meetings in my time, and I can tell you that you won't find many crowds like ours. What makes our meetings different is that our shareholders behave like true partners in the business, not just temporary holders of trading certificates. They come prepared, they engage meaningfully, and they demonstrate the kind of long-term ownership mentality we've always tried to encourage at Berkshire. When I say you can attend many annual meetings without running into a crowd like ours, I'm really saying that our shareholders understand what ownership means, and that shows in how they participate in these meetings."
