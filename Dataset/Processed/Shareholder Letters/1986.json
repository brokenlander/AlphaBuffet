        "value": "Well, this is an important distinction that I've discussed before. At most companies, you'll find book value differs widely from intrinsic business value - which is really the number that counts for owners. But at Berkshire, we're somewhat unique. For more than a decade, our book value has actually served as a reasonable, if somewhat conservative, proxy for our business value. Now, I should note that our business value has moderately exceeded our book value, with the ratio between the two remaining fairly steady. In fact, in 1986, our percentage gain in business value probably exceeded our book value gain. I say 'probably' because business value is a soft number - you could have two equally well-informed observers make judgments more than 10% apart. A big reason for this improvement in business value relative to book value comes from our outstanding managers at our major operating businesses. These managers have dramatically improved their earnings while using little additional capital, except in insurance. This creates economic value, or 'Goodwill,' that you won't see in our net worth figures or per-share book value. It's real value creation that doesn't show up in the accounting numbers."

        "value": "Let me give you the straight numbers first: over those 22 years since our management took over, our per-share book value grew from $19.46 to $2,073.06, which works out to a 23.3% compound annual growth rate. But what's particularly important here is that we achieved this through genuine business growth rather than share dilution. In fact, during this 22-year period, our corporate net worth increased by 10,600% while our shares outstanding increased by less than 1%. This is a critical point that I want to emphasize. You see, both the numerator and denominator are important in the per-share book value calculation. We've managed to grow the business substantially while keeping our share count virtually unchanged. This reflects our fundamental approach to building long-term value. In 1986 alone, we added $492.5 million to our net worth, representing a 26.1% gain. These aren't just numbers on a page - they represent real business value creation through disciplined management and capital allocation. When you look at these results, you're seeing the outcome of our focus on acquiring and growing excellent businesses with outstanding managers."

Look, when we acquire businesses, we're typically getting managers who have already proven themselves as stars in their fields. They've demonstrated their abilities across various business conditions long before we showed up. It's like if I were managing a golf team and had Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer - I wouldn't be giving them detailed instructions about their swing. That would be foolish. Our main contribution has been to create an environment where these talented individuals can continue doing what they've always done well. These managers - take the Blumkins, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, and others - have dramatically improved their businesses' earnings while using minimal additional capital. They think like owners - that's the highest compliment I can give a manager. And here's what's interesting: many of them are independently wealthy, but they keep working because they genuinely love what they do and are excited by outstanding performance. They find every aspect of their business fascinating. Our job isn't to micromanage them; it's to recognize and preserve the conditions that allowed them to become successful in the first place."

Our managers did a superb job running their operations - they improved earnings dramatically while using very little additional capital. This creates real economic value, or what we call 'Goodwill,' that doesn't show up in our balance sheet or per-share book value. But here's where I have to be candid: while our managers were executing brilliantly, I fell short in my capital allocation duties. Charlie Munger and I really have two main jobs: one is attracting and keeping outstanding managers, which we've done well at. But we also need to skillfully deploy the capital these excellent managers generate, and in 1986, I simply wasn't able to do that effectively. It's a stark reminder that business success requires both excellent operational management and skilled capital allocation. Our managers were building substantial unrecorded value through their operations, but my inability to effectively deploy the capital they generated meant we weren't maximizing our overall potential. This is why we're always clear that value creation in business requires excellence in both areas."

You see, many management books will tell you there's some magic number of direct reports an executive should have. But we've found that when you have the right people, those rules go right out the window. The key is finding managers who have two essential qualities: high character and genuine passion for their business. When you have those, you can easily have a dozen or more people reporting to you and still have time for an afternoon nap. I love to use the story of the Catholic tailor who saved for years to visit the Vatican. When his parish asked him about the Pope, all he said was 'He's a forty-four, medium.' That's the kind of occupational fervor we look for - someone so immersed in their work that they see everything through that lens. We follow David Ogilvy's philosophy: if you hire people bigger than yourself, you build a company of giants. If you hire smaller, you end up with dwarfs. It's really that simple."

The fact is, many of our key managers are independently wealthy - and we're actually quite happy about that! But here's the important part: their wealth doesn't diminish their enthusiasm one bit. Why? Because they work for reasons that go way beyond money. They work because they genuinely love what they do and get a real thrill from outstanding performance. The best compliment I can give any of our managers is that they think like owners. They find every single aspect of their business absolutely absorbing. It's not just about collecting a paycheck - it's about building something they're passionate about. And this approach has a wonderful side benefit: it makes it incredibly easy for us to expand Berkshire's activities. But I'll tell you something crucial - if you have even one person who's deceitful, inept, or uninterested, you'll find yourself with more than you can handle.

It's really that straightforward. But here's the flip side - if you have even one person who's deceitful, inept, or uninterested, you'll find yourself overwhelmed. It's like marrying for money - probably a bad idea under any circumstances, but absolute madness if you're already rich. Why would you want to work with people who make your stomach churn? Charlie and I could actually handle double our current number of managers if they had the rare qualities we look for. This policy not only maximizes our chances for good results, it also ensures we have an extraordinarily good time.

Second, we retain all that we earn - we don't pay dividends. And third, we're fortunate to have operations that generally require little incremental capital to remain competitive and grow. Let me put this in perspective: think about a business earning 23% annually and retaining it all, versus one earning 10% and distributing half to shareholders. The impact of capital allocation decisions is far more significant in the first case - which is our situation at Berkshire. This creates both opportunity and risk. If our retained earnings - and those of our major investees like GEICO and Capital Cities/ABC - are employed in an unproductive manner, the economics of Berkshire will deteriorate very quickly. That's why Charlie and I consider capital allocation one of our most crucial responsibilities. The decisions we make about where to put our money today have an outsized impact on our future results, much more so than at typical companies."

The impact of capital allocation decisions is dramatically different depending on your return rates and retention policies. Look at a business earning 23% annually and keeping all of that versus one earning 10% and paying out half to shareholders. In that first business, today's capital allocation decisions have an enormous effect on future results. If we mess up how we deploy those retained earnings - whether at Berkshire or at our major investees like GEICO and Capital Cities/ABC - our economics will deteriorate very quickly. It's like a high-powered engine - put in the wrong fuel, and you'll notice the problems fast. Now, contrast that with a company only adding 5% to net worth annually. Sure, capital allocation still matters there, but poor decisions won't change the company's trajectory nearly as rapidly. The mathematics of compounding make these differences very stark. That's why Charlie and I spend so much time thinking about capital allocation - the stakes are simply too high when you're dealing with high-return businesses retaining substantial earnings."

Now, Fechheimer was exactly what we look for - excellent economics and run by the kind of people we love to work with. But it was relatively small, using only about 2% of Berkshire's net worth. The bigger challenge was that we found ourselves drawing blanks in marketable equities - an area where just a few years earlier, we could easily put large sums to work in outstanding businesses at very reasonable prices. So we basically did two things: we paid off debt and we stockpiled funds. Now, I'll be straight with you - neither of these moves is a fate worse than death, but they're not exactly the kind of things that make Charlie and me want to do handsprings either. We're always honest about this - if we draw blanks for a few years in our capital-allocation efforts, Berkshire's growth rate will slow significantly. That's why we keep looking for operating businesses that meet our criteria, hoping to acquire one every couple of years. But we won't force it - we'd rather be patient than make a bad decision."

When you're managing the kind of capital we are now, you can't dance as quickly as you could when you were smaller. We've been upfront about hoping to average a return of 15% on equity, but to achieve that, we need our net worth to increase by $7.2 billion over the next decade. That's no small task. Charlie and I are constantly looking for operating businesses that meet our criteria, and ideally, we'd like to acquire such a business every couple of years. But here's the key point - these acquisitions have to be large to move the needle for Berkshire now. Small acquisitions, while potentially excellent businesses, simply won't materially impact our performance at our current size. We're like a huge ship now - it takes a lot more energy to change course or pick up speed. While we can't promise specific results, I can promise you that Charlie and I remain focused on finding those few very big - and good - ideas that can help us achieve our goals."

We will get our turn at bat again; we just haven't the faintest idea when that might happen. It's like waiting for the right pitch - sometimes you have to be patient in the batter's box. If Charlie and I were to continue drawing blanks for a few years in our capital-allocation endeavors, Berkshire's growth rate would slow significantly. That's just reality. But we've seen these cycles before, and we know that opportunities will eventually present themselves. The key is maintaining our discipline and standards while we wait. We won't swing at bad pitches just because we're eager to hit something. When conditions become favorable again, we'll be ready to act.

Now, Chuck Huggins - he's been invaluable here. What makes Chuck special is that he measures success by customer satisfaction, not just numbers. That attitude flows through the entire organization. You know, in retail, maintaining that kind of customer-oriented spirit is rare. Most big retailers lose it over time. But Chuck has kept that spirit alive at See's, and that's worth its weight in chocolate - and believe me, at 12,000 tons annually, that's saying something!

But there's a crucial lesson here that I want shareholders to understand, particularly as we look ahead to the 2024 annual meeting: Omaha-based Board Chairmen haven't peaked at 93. Now, I say this with a smile, but I'm also dead serious. In business, we sometimes make assumptions about age that just don't hold up. Mrs. B showed us that dedication, experience, and daily engagement in the business don't have an expiration date. When you find someone with that kind of commitment and capability, age becomes just a number.

Second, and this is crucial, we want multiple generations already active in the business. With Fechheimer, we had Bob and George Heldman in their 60s - who are actually young by our standards - plus Gary, Roger and Fred from the next generation. That gives us management continuity as far as the eye can see. Third, we need a cultural match. These families need to trust that we won't resell their business and that we'll let them operate just as they always have. You know, it's interesting - I've never even been to Cincinnati to see Fechheimer's operations.

What we really focus on are two fundamental things: First, we evaluate the economic characteristics of the business - its competitive strengths and weaknesses. We need to understand what makes the business tick and how well it can defend its position in the marketplace. Second, and equally important, we look at the quality of the people we'll be joining. In Fechheimer's case, they were a standout in both areas. The family had built a strong business and had multiple generations committed to its success.

You see, we're not interested in promises about the future or turnaround situations. I always say that if someone's promising you the moon about future earnings, keep your wallet in your pocket. We want businesses earning good returns on equity without much debt - that's crucial because it shows they have a sustainable competitive position. The management piece is also non-negotiable - we need strong leadership already in place because we can't supply it ourselves.

We'll consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic business value as we give. In fact, with the recent advances in Berkshire's stock price, stock-based transactions have become quite feasible. But here's something important - we insist on knowing the offering price upfront. We don't want to waste our time or the seller's time by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction when the price is unknown. That's why we're so quick with our responses - typically within five minutes we can tell you if we're interested. It's all about efficiency and respect for everyone's time.

We generally prefer larger transactions - while we might occasionally look at something as small as $50 million or even smaller in unusual cases, our sweet spot is really for commitments many times that size.

Let me make this crystal clear: when you see a combined ratio below 100, that means we're making an underwriting profit. Above 100, we're taking a loss. Now, here's where it gets interesting - even with a combined ratio between 107 and 112, an insurance operation can actually break even overall. Why? Because we're not just making money from underwriting. We're also earning investment income from the float - that's the money we hold onto from policyholder premiums before we have to pay claims. So when you're evaluating an insurance business, you can't just look at the combined ratio in isolation. You need to consider both the underwriting results and what we can earn on the float.

And contrary to what some might think, general inflation isn't the main villain here either - just look at the GNP deflator numbers trending down from 9.7% to 2.6%. The real culprits, as I see it, are social and judicial inflation. The cost of stepping into a courtroom has absolutely exploded. This is a fundamental challenge in our industry - when premium growth doesn't keep pace with the rising costs of settling claims, especially given today's litigious environment, the math simply doesn't work in our favor. The data shows this clearly in the combined ratios, which were running well above the break-even point until we saw significant premium increases in 1985 and 1986.

What we see happening is pretty straightforward: When conditions create a shortage and profits are good, two things inevitably occur. First, the existing insurance companies rush to issue new shares to build capital. Second, new insurers pop up and hurry to sell shares at what look like attractive prices - though I should note those prices are usually only attractive to the insiders promoting the company, not the new shareholders. This flood of new capacity leads directly to increased competition and falling prices. It's just like any other commodity market. Some industry leaders try to encourage more 'statesmanlike' pricing behavior, wanting everyone to maintain reasonable profits like The Wall Street Journal does with its pricing. But that's about as effective as a Nebraska corn farmer asking all the world's corn growers to be more statesmanlike in their marketing. In a commodity business, high profits only occur during shortage conditions, and those conditions simply don't last long. That's just the nature of the beast."

When we see price improvements in the insurance market, the earnings don't immediately reflect those changes. What we've observed is that the good news in earnings typically follows the good news in prices by about six to twelve months. Looking at 1987 as an example, we expected underwriting results to improve materially - assuming no major natural catastrophes - precisely because of this lagged recognition of price increases in revenues. But here's the critical point: these improving trends in earnings don't continue indefinitely. In fact, we could see the writing on the wall that this particular improvement cycle would likely end by late 1988 or early 1989. After that, the industry would probably head south in a hurry. This pattern is quite predictable because it's tied to how the industry responds to profitable periods by increasing capacity, which then leads to more competition and lower prices. It's a cycle that keeps repeating itself in this business."

But when the market is flooded with insurers offering prices way below expectable costs - what I call the 'here' phase - customers naturally gravitate to these temporary bargains. We don't chase that business by cutting prices. We've been the fastest-growing one year and the slowest-growing the next. In fact, we sometimes shrink, and that's perfectly fine with us.

Think about it - if your job depended on maintaining volume, you'd be tempted to write 'scads of business through thick and thin (mostly thin).'

But let's call it what it really is: a correction of previous untruths, though they weren't intentional ones. We made a special effort at the end of 1986 to get these reserves right, but I should note that we tried just as hard in 1985. The reality is that only time will tell if we've finally succeeded in correctly estimating our insurance liabilities. This is particularly important because we write some very large policies - we're talking annual premiums of $1-3 million or even higher. The nature of our business means it will always be volatile, both in volume and profitability.

This illustrates a key principle in how we operate: we won't write business just for the sake of volume. When prices don't make sense, we're perfectly willing to step back and wait for more favorable conditions. The insurance business is fundamentally a commodity business, and like any commodity business, you have to be disciplined about pricing. We expect our insurance operations to be profitable and grow over time, but we won't chase business at irrational prices.

Look at giants like Allstate and State Farm - they're excellent companies, but they simply can't match GEICO's cost structure. What makes this particularly powerful is that Bill Snyder, GEICO's Chairman, understands this concept deeply. He's not sitting still - he's constantly working to drive those costs even lower. We saw the expense ratio drop from 24.1% to 23.5% in just one year. That's what I mean by widening the moat. The beauty of this kind of competitive advantage is that it's not easily replicated. When you combine these low costs with strong service and solid underwriting standards, you've got something that's incredibly valuable and, more importantly, defensible.

When you combine these elements - the operational efficiency creating a strong competitive moat, and excellent investment management - you can see why I believe GEICO's future will be brilliant indeed. This is assuming they maintain their service and underwriting standards, which I'm confident they will.

I should note that our returns from arbitrage have significantly outperformed what we would have earned just sitting in Treasury Bills. But I always remind our shareholders that one bad experience could dramatically change that scorecard. That's why we're so selective and disciplined in our approach.

Now, we're not blind to the risks - we know we might have to sell these bonds before maturity and could face significant losses.

Second, there's actually a possibility we might sell at a profit rather than a loss.

This actually creates an interesting opportunity dynamic for us. In fact, I'd say the best scenario for us would be a market where we end up selling many of our bond holdings at a loss specifically to reallocate that capital to equity values that have become far more attractive. This might sound counterintuitive to some - deliberately taking losses - but you have to understand that we're always thinking about the relative value proposition.

It's not flashy, and it certainly won't win any awards for hyperactivity, but it works for three important reasons: First, it's an approach Charlie and I are comfortable with. Second, it produces decent results - and in business, decent long-term results beat exciting short-term maneuvers every time. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it allows our managers and those of our investees to focus on running their businesses without constant distractions. We're looking for marriages, not one-night stands, when it comes to our businesses."

But if you watch today's institutional investors during trading hours, they make whirling dervishes look positively lethargic by comparison. The hyperkinetic trading behavior we're seeing is completely at odds with what true institutional investment should be. These managers are so caught up in constant activity and trading that they've lost sight of what investing really means. It's like they're playing musical chairs with stocks instead of actually investing in businesses. At Berkshire, we find this behavior particularly puzzling because it goes against everything we believe about successful long-term investing. We prefer to let our managers focus on running their businesses rather than watching their stock prices tick up and down every second. This hyperactive trading mentality is exactly why we stick to our more stable, long-term approach - it might not be exciting, but it's rational and it works."

Take our experience at Berkshire, or look at Capital Cities/ABC and The Washington Post Company - we've seen firsthand how tax changes can affect different businesses differently.

At Berkshire, we've seen clear evidence that this isn't always the case. Sometimes the benefits stay with the company and shareholders, and sometimes they flow to customers. The reality is more nuanced than the pipeline theory suggests, and that's something investors and managers need to understand when making business decisions.

In regulated industries, like electric utilities, tax changes mostly flow through to prices rather than profits. When taxes go down, the regulators make sure those savings get passed to customers through lower prices. It's pretty mechanical. Similarly, in highly competitive industries with weak franchises, the free market acts as a kind of regulator. These companies can't just pocket the tax savings because competition forces them to lower prices to stay competitive. But here's where it gets interesting - when you have an unregulated business with a strong franchise, that's where the corporation and shareholders really win. They can keep most of those tax savings because they have the pricing power to do so. It's just like if you took the regulator away from the electric company - they'd keep those tax savings rather than passing them along. So the bottom line is that the benefits of corporate tax cuts don't always land in the same pocket. You've got to look at the business model and competitive position to understand who really wins."

Think about it this way - in highly competitive industries where companies have weak franchises, the marketplace acts very similar to how a Public Utilities Commission regulates electric companies. It's not as immediate or exact, but it gets the job done. When tax changes come along in these competitive industries, they end up affecting prices more than profits over time. The market forces companies to adjust their prices because if they don't, competitors will. Now, this is quite different from companies with strong franchises that aren't regulated. Those businesses can maintain their pricing power and keep more of the tax benefit for themselves and their shareholders. I've always found it fascinating how the free market creates this natural regulation in competitive industries. It may be delayed and irregular compared to formal utility regulation, but it's generally effective at pushing tax changes through to prices rather than letting them settle into profits. That's why understanding competitive dynamics is so crucial when you're analyzing how tax changes will play out in different industries."

The tax savings primarily benefit the corporation and its shareholders. Let me give you a practical example I often use: Think about the top brain surgeon or lawyer in your town. When their personal tax rate drops from 50% to 28%, do you really expect them to cut their fees? Of course not. They're the franchise holders in their specialty, and they'll keep those tax benefits. It's the same principle with our unregulated businesses. The money stays in our pocket rather than the customer's. Now, I know this might not be politically popular to say, but it's simply impossible to deny. That's why we need to be clear-eyed about who really benefits from these tax changes."

Based on our analysis, we're looking at one of two scenarios within about five years - either tax rates will have to go up, or we'll see higher inflation, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get both. I should also mention something specific to Berkshire - they've increased corporate capital gains tax rates from 28% to 34% starting in 1987. This is particularly relevant for us because historically, a significant portion of our business value growth has come from capital gains, and we expect that pattern to continue.

In most price-competitive industries - take aluminum, automobiles, or department stores - all the major players are generally working with similar tax equations. When taxes go up or down, they all face similar impacts and can pass these changes along to customers. But property/casualty insurance is different. You see, not all major insurers are playing with the same tax deck of cards. Some companies will get hit hard by the new alternative minimum tax while others won't feel it much at all. Then you've got some big insurers sitting on huge loss carry-forwards that'll shield their income from significant taxes for at least a few years. And don't forget about those insurers that are part of larger corporations - their results get folded into consolidated returns with non-insurance businesses. These different situations create widely varying marginal tax rates across the industry. When companies in the same competitive space are dealing with different tax equations, it becomes much harder to simply pass those costs along to customers. That's why our property/casualty operations will feel these tax changes more directly than companies in other price-competitive industries."

That's because front-loading taxes significantly reduces the amount of money you have working for you over time. It's the same principle at work in our insurance operations. When we have to pay taxes upfront instead of deferring them, it cuts into our profitability in a meaningful way. The money we're paying in taxes today is money that can't be reinvested in our business, can't compound over time, and can't work to generate additional returns. This front-ending of taxes, as we call it, is going to take a real toll on our business.

The only difference is the accounting treatment because we paid a different amount than the stated net worth when Berkshire purchased it. Under GAAP rules, these differences - the premiums or discounts - require what we call 'purchase-price adjustments.' So while the underlying economics are identical, the reported numbers diverge significantly - we see net income of $40,231 in the O column versus $28,605 in the N column.

The only difference is in how the accounting rules require us to present these identical facts.

You see, when we bought Scott Fetzer, we had this interesting situation where you could look at the same business two different ways - one showing $40.2 million in earnings, another showing $28.6 million.

The challenge is that this isn't a precise science - it's often a difficult guess to make. Think about Company O and Company N from our example. Even though their GAAP numbers looked different, their owner earnings were identical because this maintenance capex requirement - part (c) - had to be the same in both cases. This makes sense because they're essentially the same business. When you're looking at working capital requirements, there's an interesting wrinkle with LIFO inventory businesses - they usually don't need additional working capital if their unit volume stays steady. But overall, while this maintenance capex figure isn't as precise as accountants might like, it's crucial for understanding what a business is really worth.

When a business needs to spend more than its depreciation just to hold its ground - both in terms of unit volume and competitive position - the GAAP earnings are painting too rosy a picture. I'll give you a clear example from the oil industry. In recent years, if major oil companies had only spent what their depreciation amounts suggested, they would have guaranteed their shrinkage in real terms.

Here's why: these businesses absolutely must make ongoing capital investments to stay competitive and maintain their operations. You can defer these investments for a year or two, sure, but over any meaningful period - say five or ten years - you simply must make these investments or your business decays. It's just like maintaining your house - you can skip repairs for a while, but eventually, the bill comes due. What troubles me is how investment bankers and marketers use these cash flow numbers to make unsound businesses look better than they are.

What we're actually paying them for is to provide us with standardized financial information - the numbers that Charlie and I then use as our starting point for analysis. You see, it's a two-step process. First, you need those accounting numbers as your foundation - they're absolutely crucial. But then comes the real work: evaluation and interpretation. That's where the business judgment comes in, and that's not something you can delegate to the accounting department. It's why I always emphasize that accounting is an aid to business thinking, but you can't use it as a substitute for actually thinking about the business."
