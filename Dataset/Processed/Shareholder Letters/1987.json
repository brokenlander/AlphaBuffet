Let me give you some real examples from our experience. Look at LTV and Baldwin-United right before they went bankrupt. Their audited book values showed $652 million and $397 million respectively. Those numbers meant nothing - they went bankrupt! On the flip side, take Belridge Oil. It sold to Shell for $3.6 billion when its book value was only $177 million. That's exactly what I mean by these values being unrelated in many cases. At Berkshire, we've been fortunate that our book value has tracked fairly closely with business value, with business value actually growing a bit faster over the last decade. But this isn't typical. What really counts - and I want to emphasize this - is the rate of gain in per-share business value, not book value. That's what creates real wealth for shareholders. You've got to look beyond the accounting numbers to understand what a business is really worth."

Let me be direct about what I see in many annual reports: CEOs will spend pages and pages describing what is clearly inadequate corporate performance, but then they'll inevitably throw in this warm, fuzzy paragraph about their managers being their 'most precious asset.' It's almost become a corporate ritual. At Berkshire, we actually do have remarkable managers - and our performance backs that up. Our premium of business value to book value has widened specifically because we own some remarkable businesses and they are run by even more remarkable managers. But I understand why shareholders might be skeptical of such claims. They've heard this story too many times from CEOs who are really just trying to put a good face on poor performance. The difference is that we let our results speak for themselves - over the last 23 years, our per-share book value has grown at 23.1% compounded annually. That kind of performance doesn't come from mediocre management."

To put this in perspective, Fortune magazine found that out of 1000 of the largest companies in America, only six managed to average ROE above 30% over a decade, with Commerce Clearing House leading the pack at 40.2%. Now, when we acquire these high-ROE businesses at Berkshire, we typically pay a premium above their book value - and that's perfectly fine. Here's the key point: what we pay for a business doesn't affect the amount of capital its manager has to work with. Think about it like buying shares of Commerce Clearing House at six times book value - that purchase price doesn't change CCH's underlying return on equity at all. The manager's performance should be judged on the returns they achieve with their underlying assets, not on our acquisition price. That's why we're comfortable paying substantial premiums for extraordinary businesses - in our case, about $222 million above historical book values for these seven units. The fundamental economics of the business is what matters, not the price we pay to own it."

        "value": "Let me explain why these types of businesses are so valuable to us at Berkshire. When you have operations that generate high returns while requiring very little capital, you get three tremendous advantages. First, the real business value of these operations ends up being far above their historical book value and what we carry on our balance sheet. That's real value creation that doesn't show up in the accounting numbers. Second - and this is crucial - because these businesses need so little capital to operate, they can grow while simultaneously making almost all of their earnings available for us to deploy elsewhere. Think of it as a double benefit - you get growth in the core business while also having nearly all the earnings free to invest in new opportunities. Third, and I can't emphasize this enough, these businesses are run by truly extraordinary managers. When you combine minimal capital requirements with exceptional management, you get remarkable results. That's why we're always on the lookout for businesses with these characteristics - they're rare, but when you find them, they're incredibly valuable to own."

Now, that doesn't mean our managers don't use these tools in their own operations - many do and that's fine. But what could Charlie and I possibly tell the Blumkins about selling furniture or the Heldmans about uniforms? Our main contribution is applause - but not the mindless kind. We've spent decades studying businesses and watching managers work, so we know a virtuoso performance when we see one. It's like being a longtime critic at the opera - you develop an ear for excellence. When our managers deliver outstanding results, as they did in 1987, they deserve sustained, deafening applause. That's our job - to recognize and encourage excellence, not to micromanage people who know their businesses far better than we do."

In our reporting, we don't charge amortization of goodwill and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments against specific businesses. Instead, we show these items separately and aggregated. What we're trying to do is show you how these businesses would have performed if we hadn't purchased them - their true operational performance, if you will. I've explained this in detail in my 1983 and 1986 letters because we believe this presentation is more useful to both investors and managers than the standard GAAP approach of making these adjustments on a business-by-business basis. It's about clarity and understanding the real operational performance of our businesses. We want our shareholders and managers to see the businesses as they actually operate, not as accounting conventions might dictate. This might seem like a technical point, but it's important for understanding the true economics of our businesses."

You see, many investors get excited about businesses promising dramatic change or revolutionary developments. They love to assign high price-earnings ratios to exotic-sounding companies that promise feverish change. But in my experience, that's exactly backwards. Look at our own businesses - the table shows that during 1987, our companies performed well precisely because they remained stable and consistent. There's not much new to report about them, and that's exactly how we like it. Think of it this way: these investors are like people who always prefer a blind date to the girl next door, regardless of how desirable she might be.

But when we look at our businesses, we want to see them aging in a more upbeat way. The detailed financial table shows exactly that - almost all of our businesses improved their performance in 1987. We have See's Candies, Scott Fetzer, World Book, and others all showing solid numbers. What's particularly important is that we don't see wild swings or dramatic changes. Instead, we see steady, reliable performance from established businesses. That's what we're after - consistent performers that maintain their fundamental characteristics while growing their earnings. We don't need flashy new developments or revolutionary changes to generate good returns.

Now, don't misunderstand me - I'm not advocating for complacency. Companies should absolutely improve their services, products, and operations. But here's the key point: when a business is constantly dealing with major changes, it's also exposing itself to major risks of error. Think about it this way - if you're trying to build a fortress-like business franchise on ground that's constantly shifting beneath your feet, that's a pretty tough proposition. The Fortune study we looked at backs this up perfectly. When they identified the true business superstars - companies with over 20% ROE for a decade and no year below 15% - most of them were in rather mundane, stable businesses. They weren't chasing the latest exciting venture or transforming themselves every few years. They were simply executing well in established markets. I've always been skeptical of investor-dreamers who prefer any blind date to the girl next door, so to speak. They'd rather fantasize about future profitability than face today's business realities.

First, these high-performing companies - and we're talking about businesses that maintained an average return on equity above 20% for a decade, never dipping below 15% - share some surprising characteristics. One thing that might surprise people is that these superstar companies typically use very little leverage compared to their interest-paying capacity. Really good businesses usually don't need to borrow - that's a fundamental truth I've observed over and over. Another interesting point is that, except for one high-tech company and a few pharmaceutical firms, most of these outstanding performers are in what you might call mundane businesses. They're not the exciting, headline-grabbing companies that investors often dream about. They've built what I call fortress-like business franchises - strong, stable operations that can sustain high returns over long periods. And the market recognizes this value: 24 out of these 25 companies outperformed the S&P 500 during the decade we studied. So what we're seeing is that sustained excellence doesn't usually come from flashy businesses or aggressive financial engineering - it comes from strong, stable companies executing well in established markets."

When we looked at highly successful companies, we found they typically weren't doing anything fancy - they were selling non-sexy products or services pretty much the same way they did a decade ago. The real key is making the most of an already strong business franchise or concentrating on a single winning business theme. And here's something important - really good businesses usually don't need to borrow. Look at our own experience at Berkshire. Our managers have achieved extraordinary results by doing rather ordinary things, but doing them exceptionally well. They focus on protecting their franchises, controlling costs, and finding new products that build on existing strengths. They don't get distracted by shiny new things. Instead, they work incredibly hard at the details of their businesses. That's what creates exceptional economics - not complex strategies, but excellent execution of simple, sound business principles."

What's remarkable about Mrs. B - and this really illustrates my point about exceptional execution - is that at 94 years old, she still works seven days a week, from opening until closing. She's hands-on in every aspect - buying, selling, managing - and consistently outperforms the competition. This is exactly what I mean when I talk about concentrating on a single winning business theme. She didn't diversify into unrelated businesses or chase trendy new ventures. She focused entirely on building and running the best furniture business possible. Like Agatha Christie's archaeologist husband who became more interested as things got older, Mrs. B's business approach has only become more valuable with time. It's a perfect example of how focused management, combined with relentless attention to detail and unwavering dedication to the core business, creates exceptional results."

That would save us about $4 million annually in newsprint costs. But here's the key point - we're not interested in that kind of short-term thinking. We maintain our commitment to comprehensive local coverage because that's what serves our community and fulfills our mission as a newspaper.

What we've seen at See's, particularly under Chuck Huggins' leadership for the past 16 years, is that success in retail candy requires two fundamental things. First, you need an excellent product, which we absolutely have. But more importantly, you need genuine affection for the customer. Chuck is 100% customer-oriented, and that attitude permeates the entire See's organization. Look at the industry - practically no one besides See's has made significant profits in recent years from operating candy shops. So it's not a rising tide lifting all boats. What Chuck has achieved is truly a one-of-a-kind performance. The proof is in how our customers react when we make changes they don't like. When we tried removing a couple of candy varieties, our customers let us know in no uncertain terms how unhappy they were - threatening everything from mandatory injunctions to wishing our truffles would melt in transit!

Now, what's particularly noteworthy is our same-store sales pattern. For the second consecutive year, our same-store sales, measured in pounds, were virtually unchanged. You might think that's not exciting news, but it actually represents real improvement because in each of the previous six years, same-store sales had been declining. What's become increasingly clear is the extreme seasonality of our business. The Christmas season is absolutely crucial to See's success - in fact, about 85% of our profit was earned during December of 1987. And we're seeing this seasonal concentration become even more pronounced. Even though we had a strong Christmas in 1986, our store-for-store comparisons in the 1987 Christmas season were even better than at any other time of the year. This kind of business pattern requires very careful management and planning - you've got to get it right during that critical holiday period because that's when the vast majority of your annual profit is made."

Now, this isn't because we're seeing more accidents or natural disasters. And in recent times, it's not even general inflation that's the culprit. What we're really wrestling with is social and judicial inflation. Based on what we're seeing in the numbers and trends, the industry needs about 10% annual revenue growth just to maintain its profitability position. That's true even when general inflation is running quite a bit lower. Think of it as a treadmill - you need to keep moving at a certain speed just to stay in place. The combined ratio tells this story pretty clearly. When you look at those numbers from 1985-87, you can see how the strong revenue gains during that period set the stage for excellent underwriting performance in 1987. It's a fundamental principle of the insurance business that premium growth needs to outpace loss cost inflation to maintain profitability."

Second, and this is equally important, we're seeing judges and juries expanding insurance policy coverage beyond what was ever contemplated when these policies were written. Looking at the combined ratio, which is really just total insurance costs compared to premium revenues, these factors are pushing the numbers higher. When you see a combined ratio above 100, that means we're paying out more in losses and expenses than we're taking in from premiums. Now, the industry can typically break even with a combined ratio in the 107-111 range when you factor in investment income from the float - that's the money we hold onto from policyholders before paying claims. But these escalating court costs and expanding interpretations of coverage are putting constant upward pressure on the loss side of that ratio.

But here's the real kicker: the product itself can't be meaningfully differentiated. When you're selling what amounts to a commodity, you've only got two paths to sustainable profitability. You either need to be the absolute lowest-cost operator in the market, or you need to find yourself a protected niche, usually a small one, where you can build some competitive moat. Now, there is one situation where even a commodity business like insurance can do well - when there are shortages. That's when everyone can flourish. But those periods don't last forever. We've found that just to maintain profitability, the industry needs revenue growth of about 10% annually, even when general inflation is running much lower.

It's like when the party's over and the bar closes - you still get to finish the drink in your hand. We saw this play out in 1987-88. The industry had strong revenue gains of 12.9% and 11.1% in early 1987, which practically guaranteed excellent underwriting performance that year. But then things started souring - gains dropped to 5.7% and 5.6% in later quarters. By 1988, we knew revenue gains would fall well below our 10% 'equilibrium' figure. But here's the key - earnings didn't immediately tank. Based on this pattern, and assuming no major natural catastrophes hit, we predicted a small increase in the industry's combined ratio for 1988, followed by several years of larger increases. That's the nature of this lag effect - it gives you a false sense of security at first, but the reality catches up eventually."

You see, whenever a shortage appears and money starts flowing in, these managers just can't help themselves. They rush to expand capacity, which effectively kills the very shortage that was making them money. We saw this play out perfectly in the insurance industry during 1985-87. The managers just couldn't resist adding capacity, and as Disraeli wisely noted, 'What we learn from history is that we do not learn from history.' In a commodity business, you can only sustain high profitability if you're either the absolute low-cost operator or if you've found yourself a protected niche, usually a small one. Everything else is just temporary prosperity that managers tend to destroy through their own actions."

In personal insurance - think auto or homeowners policies - our financial strength means virtually nothing. The reality is that customers will get their claims paid even if their insurer fails, as many have. And in commercial insurance, our strength often doesn't matter as much as you might think. When times are good, many big corporate insurance buyers and their brokers barely consider an insurer's long-term ability to pay. They're not thinking about what might happen five years down the road when a complex claim finally needs to be settled. It's a classic case of 'out of sight, out of mind' - though it might later become a case of 'out-of-pocket.'

When buyers finally wake up and start focusing on whether their insurer can actually pay that $10 million claim years from now, especially if poor underwriting conditions hit at the same time as depressed markets and reinsurer defaults, they find very few companies they can truly trust. That's where Berkshire shines. We maintain exceptional financial strength that sets us apart when people start asking the hard questions about long-term reliability. We're built to weather any storm, and that becomes a major competitive advantage when buyers get serious about security. It's not just about who can offer coverage today - it's about who will definitely be there to pay claims years from now. And in that category, Berkshire leads the pack."

If conditions are right in 1989, we'll happily write five times what we did in 1988. But if conditions aren't right, we'll just as happily write only one-fifth as much. This approach sets us apart because no other major insurer shows this kind of restraint. Now, you might wonder how we can operate this way. Well, insurance has three unique conditions that make this possible. The first key point is that market share doesn't determine profitability in insurance like it does in other businesses. Unlike newspapers or grocery stores, we don't need to be the fattest to survive. We can't control market prices, and we won't chase volume just to hit some arbitrary growth target. If prices are unsatisfactory, we'll simply do very little business. That's it. We don't feel any pressure to write policies just to maintain market share, and that's a wonderful position to be in. It gives us the flexibility to wait for the right opportunities and only write business when it makes sense."

You don't need to be the fattest to survive, as I like to say. Second - and this is really interesting - our distribution channels aren't locked up like they are in other industries. If we write a small amount of business this year, that doesn't stop us from writing huge volumes next year. The doors are always open. Third, and this is a big advantage, we can operate at partial capacity without destroying our economics. Look at printing or steel - they need to run near full capacity to make money. But in insurance, we can run at quarter-speed much of the time and still prosper long-term. These three factors give us tremendous flexibility in how we operate. We can scale up or down as opportunities present themselves, and we don't have to chase bad business just to keep the lights on. It's a wonderful business model when you understand these dynamics."

We're always ready to write huge volumes of almost any type of property-casualty insurance when our prices are met. This is quite different from many other insurers who follow what I call an in-and-out approach. When these competitors are 'out' - maybe because they've had too many losses or don't have enough capital - we're still there, ready to write business. Now, sure, when everyone else is eager to write policies, we're there too, but we often find ourselves priced above the market. That's fine with us. We'd rather be available all the time at adequate prices than chase business at inadequate ones.

Think about things like product liability or directors and officers liability coverage. The unpredictability of our legal system makes it virtually impossible for even the most conscientious insurer to accurately judge what these long-tail claims will eventually cost. Looking at the record of the last decade, we've seen many of our most prominent insurers report earnings that later turned out to be wildly off the mark. I want to be clear - in most cases, these weren't deliberate deceptions. It's simply the nature of the business. When you're trying to estimate costs that might not materialize for years or even decades, precision is an illusion.

This isn't a small discrepancy we're talking about. The unpredictability of our legal system makes it impossible for even the most conscientious insurer to come close to judging the eventual cost of long-tail claims. So while the auditors are following their standard procedures, I believe this creates a misleading sense of precision and certainty. It's particularly problematic with long-tail business, where the final costs might not be known for many years.

The issue is with the opinion letter format that doesn't acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in casualty insurance accounting. When auditors say something 'presents fairly,' the average investor naturally takes that as a strong endorsement. But in reality, these professionals are relying heavily on management's estimates of loss reserves, which can be way off base. I believe the opinion letters need to be more forthright about these limitations from the start. If lawsuits develop later about inaccurate statements - and they do - the auditors will eventually have to acknowledge these limitations in court anyway. So why not be upfront with shareholders from the beginning? We need opinion language that clearly states they're relying on management's representations about loss reserves and that they can't really verify those numbers.

We can express no opinion about the accuracy of these figures.' Now, I know they're planning to change the wording next year, and while that's an improvement, it still doesn't go far enough in describing the real limitations of a casualty-insurer audit. The key here is transparency. We need to acknowledge that these loss reserve estimates very materially affect reported earnings and financial condition, and that auditors simply cannot verify their accuracy. This isn't about pointing fingers - remember, we're not faulting auditors for their inability to accurately assess loss reserves. It's about being honest with shareholders about what an audit can and cannot do.

You see, when you're dealing with long-tail insurance, where claims might not be settled for years or even decades, it's impossible for anyone to precisely evaluate those reserves. What troubles me is that this creates an environment where some unscrupulous operators can exploit this weakness. When 'earnings' can be created by simply writing different numbers on a piece of paper, you can bet that dishonest people will be drawn to that opportunity like moths to a flame. For them, long-tail insurance is heaven. What we need is simple: auditors should be forthright from the start about what they can and cannot do.

The Act actually increased reported earnings for insurers in the short term - at Berkshire, for instance, we saw our 1987 earnings inflated by $8.2 million due to what they called a 'fresh start' adjustment. But here's the real kicker - while it made the immediate numbers look better, it simultaneously reduced both the long-term earnings potential and the fundamental business value of insurance companies. The impact of these tax changes became even more severe by the end of 1987. This is why I consider it the most important economic event affecting the insurance industry in that decade. It's a perfect example of how accounting rules and tax laws can create a misleading picture of business reality. You've got to look beyond the immediate earnings boost and understand the long-term implications.

But then, like a pendulum swinging the other way, he falls into these deep depressions where he can see nothing but trouble ahead - not just for the business, but for the entire world. During these gloomy periods, he becomes absolutely terrified that you're going to dump your interest on him, so he names a very low price.

Now, sometimes the market might ignore business success for a while, but that's actually fine with us.

But I've learned that this advantage isn't quite what it appears to be. You see, changing management is a lot like changing spouses - it's painful, time-consuming, and you're never quite sure how the new arrangement will work out. When we own marketable securities, it's usually much easier to simply exit the position if we're unhappy. That said, when you've got outstanding managers like we do at Cap Cities with Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, or at GEICO with Bill Snyder and Lou Simpson, or at The Washington Post with Kay Graham and Dick Simmons, the whole question becomes moot. The real lesson here is that we try to buy not just good businesses, but ones run by high-grade, talented, and likeable managers. Sometimes we misread the fundamental economics of a business - just like that European reporter who thought Carnegie made his fortune running libraries rather than steel mills - but having great managers in place helps minimize those risks."

That's a crucial difference from owning marketable securities, where we typically have little or no say in these decisions. I learned this lesson the hard way in my early days when I was searching for bargains and found some real learning experiences - those investments in short-line farm implement manufacturers, third-place department stores, and New England textile manufacturers taught me plenty about the importance of capital allocation. You see, when you're just a shareholder, even a large one, you're essentially riding along with whatever capital allocation decisions management makes. But when you control the business, you can ensure capital is deployed in ways that create the most value. This becomes particularly important because even good businesses can become poor investments if capital isn't allocated wisely. That's why having this control is so valuable - it lets us directly influence one of the most critical aspects of long-term business success."

Most CEOs get to the top because they're excellent at something specific - maybe they're brilliant at marketing, outstanding in production, or they really know their way around engineering. But here's the catch - once they become CEO, they suddenly have to make these critical capital allocation decisions, something they may have never done before. I like to explain it with a music analogy: it's as if you took a brilliant musician and, instead of having them perform at Carnegie Hall, you suddenly made them Chairman of the Federal Reserve. It's a completely different skill set. Now, when these CEOs realize they're not great at capital allocation - and mind you, not all of them even recognize this - they often try to fix it by turning to their staffs, management consultants, or investment bankers. But Charlie and I have watched this play out many times, and I'll tell you, this 'help' usually makes things worse, not better. It tends to accentuate the problem rather than solve it. The impact of this is significant - just think about it: after ten years as CEO, if a company retains earnings equal to 10% of net worth annually, that CEO will have been responsible for deploying over 60% of all the capital in the business. That's why we see so much unintelligent capital allocation in corporate America."

When we control a company, we can ensure capital is allocated intelligently and efficiently. You see, this isn't just about having a say in decisions - it's about having the right people making those decisions. In our controlled companies, we can apply our decades of experience in capital allocation to make sure shareholders' money is working as hard as it can. This is particularly valuable given what we've observed about typical corporate capital allocation. The reality is that plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes place in corporate America, and when you're just a minority shareholder in marketable securities, you're often stuck watching from the sidelines as capital allocation decisions are made by others who might not have the skill set for it. That's why having control and being able to make these decisions ourselves is such a significant advantage."

In fact, with recent tax code changes, the same business results can deliver up to 50% better financial outcomes for Berkshire when we have that 80%-or-greater ownership versus a minority stake. It's just simple math - as a corporate holder, we face some meaningful tax costs with partial positions that we can avoid with controlling ownership. Now, this doesn't mean we only pursue controlling stakes - far from it. But it's certainly a factor we have to weigh carefully in our capital allocation decisions. Think of it this way: if you have two identical businesses with identical results, but one is owned at 85% and another at 40%, the after-tax benefit to Berkshire can be dramatically different. That's just the reality of how the corporate tax system works, and we have to be cognizant of these effects when we're evaluating different investment opportunities."

Or look at GEICO - we paid an average of $6.67 per share in the late 1970s, and its after-tax operating earnings per share reached $9.01 last year. These are extraordinary businesses that we were able to buy pieces of at truly ridiculous prices - far below what we would have had to pay in a negotiated transaction for control. So while yes, there are tax inefficiencies with minority stakes, and yes, we generally prefer having control of our businesses, we're not going to pass up opportunities to buy wonderful businesses at wonderful prices just because we can't get 80% ownership. The stock market occasionally serves up bargains that are just too good to ignore, and we'd be foolish to let tax considerations prevent us from taking advantage of those opportunities when they arise."

What we do instead is focus solely on future earning power - that's what really matters. We develop our own ideas of business value that are completely independent from both the accounting values on our books and what the market might be saying about our partially-owned companies. Sometimes the market can be quite foolish in its valuations, so we don't let that influence our thinking. What we're really trying to do is increase the true business value at a reasonable rate - or preferably an unreasonable rate - over time.

Second, we're not trying to maximize current reportable earnings - that's not our game at all. What we're focused on is maximizing eventual net worth.

The more prices fell, the more it forced them to sell, regardless of the underlying value of the businesses. By October 1987, we had somewhere between $60 billion to $90 billion worth of stocks sitting on this hair trigger, according to the Brady Report. This is exactly the kind of mechanical approach that creates market instability. It completely ignores business fundamentals and instead relies on automatic selling triggers. It's a perfect example of what happens when investors stop thinking about stocks as ownership in businesses and start treating them as abstract tokens in a trading game.

The craziest part is that these strategies then tell you to buy back the same companies once prices rebound significantly. It's pure Alice-in-Wonderland thinking. When you own part of a good business, you don't automatically sell it just because someone else is willing to pay less for it at a particular moment.

We're seeing our enormous trade deficit causing what I call 'claim checks' - these are U.S. government and corporate bonds, bank deposits, and similar instruments - accumulating in foreign hands at what I'd call a distressing rate. Our government has essentially adopted what I like to compare to Blanche DuBois's approach in A Streetcar Named Desire - 'I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.' But here's the problem: when these claim checks become numerous enough, and when the issuing party - in this case, our government - can unilaterally determine their purchasing power, there's almost irresistible pressure to dilute their value through inflation.

However, I want to emphasize something important about our philosophy here: regardless of their market price, we maintain complete flexibility and are ready to sell these bonds whenever we spot a better opportunity. This is crucial because we're not married to any investment. The tax-exempt feature of our grandfathered bonds gives us an advantage that's not available with bonds currently purchased by insurance companies.

Our relatively good past record for fiscal integrity has allowed us to break the normal rules about foreign debt, but that same generosity might actually make the eventual pressure to inflate even worse.

We believe that good business and investment decisions will eventually produce quite satisfactory economic results without taking on unnecessary risks. Look, we could probably handle more aggressive approaches, but we deliberately choose policies - in debt and all other matters - that will work under extraordinarily adverse conditions rather than optimal conditions. Why? Because we're thinking about all our stakeholders. We have policyholders, employees - innocent bystanders, if you will - whose welfare we're responsible for. It would be improper to risk their wellbeing just to chase some extra returns that are relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things. This isn't about being overly conservative - we maintain diverse revenue streams, keep substantial liquid assets, and structure what debt we do have very carefully. But we want certainty about meeting our obligations, not just likelihood. That's been our consistent philosophy throughout Berkshire's history, and it's served us well through all kinds of economic conditions."

        "value": "Well, we take a rather different approach than many others. You see, we prefer to finance in anticipation of need rather than in reaction to it. This is a crucial distinction. At Berkshire, we're fortunate to have several strengths that give us flexibility - diverse earnings streams from well-entrenched businesses, low capital requirements, well-structured debt, and substantial liquid assets. This means we could actually be comfortable with more debt than we currently carry. But here's the key point: we believe managing liabilities is just as important as managing assets. You want the highest return on assets and lowest cost on liabilities. But here's the catch - these opportunities rarely line up perfectly. In fact, logic suggests they'll often be opposite. When money's tight and borrowing costs are high, that's often when you'll find the best acquisition opportunities. When money's cheap, that's when asset prices tend to get bid up to the sky. So we sometimes act on the liability side independently of the asset side. It's about being prepared rather than reactive."

That's just the reality of it. What's 'tight' and 'cheap' money isn't always clear at any particular time. So we take a much simpler approach: we borrow when conditions seem non-oppressive. Then we wait patiently, hoping we'll find intelligent expansion or acquisition opportunities later. And ironically, those opportunities tend to show up most often when conditions in the debt market are clearly oppressive. It's not about trying to perfectly time the market - it's about being prepared with the financial flexibility to act when opportunities arise. Our approach is built on our core strengths: diverse earnings, low capital needs, well-structured debt, and substantial liquid assets. These give us the ability to be patient and opportunistic rather than trying to predict the unpredictable."

We borrow when conditions aren't oppressive, and then we wait patiently for the right opportunities. It's like carrying a loaded gun when you're hunting elephants - you need to be ready when that rare opportunity presents itself. Now, this approach does penalize our near-term earnings. Just look at our recent situation - we're earning about 6 1/2% on $250 million that's costing us 10%. That's roughly $160,000 per week we're losing on the spread. But you know what? That negative spread doesn't bother us one bit. We won't stretch for acquisitions or chase higher yields in short-term instruments just to close that gap. If we find the right business elephant in the next five years, that waiting cost will have been worth every penny. And I'll tell you something else - we have absolutely no ability to forecast interest rates. We maintain our usual open-minded spirit about this and believe no one else can predict them either. That's why we focus on being prepared rather than trying to time the market perfectly."

We want to see the actual performance. Third, we look for businesses that earn good returns on equity while employing little or no debt. That's crucial. Fourth, and this is very important - we need management in place because we can't supply it ourselves. Fifth, we want simple businesses. If there's lots of technology involved, we won't understand it, and we're very clear about that limitation. Finally, we need an offering price right upfront. We don't want to waste anyone's time - ours or the seller's - by talking about a transaction when we don't know the price. These aren't just guidelines - they're requirements. And if you have a business that fits all these criteria, we'd love to hear from you. But please, write rather than call. That's our preferred method of initial contact."

We want to see what a business has actually done, not what someone thinks it might do. We're particularly fond of companies that can generate good returns on equity without loading up on debt. And here's something crucial - we want simple businesses. If there's lots of technology involved, Charlie and I won't understand it. We like to stay within our circle of competence. You know, it's like the old saying - better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. That's why we avoid turnarounds or businesses we can't easily understand. We also need management in place because we can't supply it ourselves.

We won't engage in unfriendly takeovers - that's not our style. We also don't get involved in auction-like sales or those situations where brokers say 'I'm sure something will work out if you people get to know each other.' Those kinds of deals never attract us. We're also not interested in new ventures or turnarounds. What we want is clear communication and a fair price right from the start. That's why we ask for an offering price upfront. For the right business and the right people, we can provide a good home.

        "value": "Well, I have a pretty straightforward view on this. When corporate officers direct company money to charities without consulting shareholders, they're essentially taking money from the owners and giving it to their own preferred causes. Let me put it this way - when A takes money from B to give to C and A is a legislator, we call that taxation. But when A is a corporate officer doing the same thing, suddenly it's called philanthropy. I don't see much difference. About 50% of major American companies match directors' charitable contributions, sometimes even tripling them. But here's a thought experiment - how would these directors feel if shareholders could reach into their personal pockets for charities the shareholders prefer? At Berkshire, we believe contributions should reflect the charitable preferences of the owners rather than those of officers and directors. That's why we have our shareholder-designated contributions program, where 97.2% of eligible shares participated in 1987, directing $4.9 million to 2,050 charities. Unless there are clear direct benefits to the company, we think the owners should decide where their charitable dollars go."

When we had a managerial problem at K & W, Charlie, who oversees that operation, didn't need to consult with me at all. He simply called Harry, made him CEO at age 68, and then just waited for the magic to happen. And boy, did it happen quickly. The results speak for themselves - in 1987, K & W's profits hit a record high, jumping more than 300% from 1986. But here's what's really impressive - while profits were soaring, the capital employed actually went down. They reduced their investment in accounts receivable and inventories by 20%. That's the kind of efficiency we love to see. It shows that sometimes the best thing you can do is find the right person and get out of their way. And I'll tell you this - if we run into another managerial problem ten or twenty years down the road, we know exactly who to call. It's a reminder that good management is absolutely crucial to business success."
