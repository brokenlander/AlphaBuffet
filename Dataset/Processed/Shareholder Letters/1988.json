Now, this is necessarily an estimate, but it's crucial to understand that it can differ significantly from book value. In our case at Berkshire, our calculations show that our intrinsic business value significantly exceeds our book value. Looking at the historical pattern, over our 24-year period, business value has actually grown somewhat faster than book value. However, 1988 was a bit unusual - it was one of those years where book value actually grew faster than business value. This is similar to how you might see short-term variations in any business metric, but it's the long-term trend that matters. Think of it like this: book value is like looking at the scoreboard at one moment in the game, while intrinsic value is more like understanding the true strength and potential of the team on the field."

We're facing four significant headwinds: First, the stock market is less attractive than it generally was during our previous 24-year period. Second, we're dealing with higher corporate tax rates on most forms of investment income. Third, the market for acquiring businesses has become far more richly-priced, which makes it harder to find good deals. Fourth, and this is particularly important since it affects about half of our net worth, the industry conditions for our three permanent investments - Capital Cities/ABC, GEICO, and The Washington Post Company - range from slightly to materially less favorable than they were five to ten years ago.

Let me give you the stark reality: four years ago, we needed $3.9 billion in profits for a 15% annual return over the following decade. Now, we need $10.3 billion for the same percentage return. That's a very big number - even Charlie and I find it daunting. The challenge grows in significance each year, just like age. Though I should note that, like aging, it's better to have this problem continue than to have it 'solved' - because that would mean we're shrinking! The larger we get, the harder it becomes to find enough attractive opportunities to deploy our capital at the returns we've historically achieved. It's simple mathematics really, but it's also one of our biggest challenges. And as I sometimes joke with Charlie, if these numbers prove too big, you'll find him retrospectively identified as the senior partner in future reports."

We face a real challenge with our growing capital base - it's a big drag on returns, and both Charlie and I recognize that. But we're in a much better position than we were 24 years ago. Back then, all our capital was trapped in a textile business with terrible economics - there was no way around that. Today, we've got what we call our Sainted Seven - businesses like See's, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and Buffalo News - that are truly exceptional. These operations earned about 67% on average equity capital last year, with no financial leverage. That's remarkable. The key here is that these businesses combine two critical elements: most have exceptional business franchises, and all have exceptional management. Our contribution? We leave these managers alone. They're delivering superb returns, which we absolutely need to have any shot at our 15% goal. So while the growing capital base is still a challenge, these exceptional businesses give us a fighting chance. The real question isn't whether our operating managers will deliver - they will. The question is whether Charlie and I can effectively deploy the capital they generate."

Our greatest contribution is that we leave these managers alone to run their businesses. Look at the results - these operations earned about 67% on average equity capital, and that's without any financial leverage. We've got businesses like Buffalo News, See's, Nebraska Furniture Mart, and others that consistently deliver extraordinary returns. When you have managers who can produce these kinds of results, the worst thing you can do is interfere. That's why we stick to a hands-off approach. These businesses, as a group, will continue to produce superb returns - I'm confident about that. And we need them to, because without their performance, Berkshire wouldn't have a prayer of reaching our 15% goal. The managers will do their part - that's a certainty. Our job is simply to make sure we don't mess up a good thing."

Think about it this way - if a subsidiary manager only gave me bare-bones GAAP numbers without the critical context I need to understand the business, they'd be in trouble pretty quickly. So why should CEOs treat their shareholders any differently? The shareholders are the owners - they're the bosses. Any CEO who stops at basic GAAP reporting when their owners need more information to make informed decisions isn't fulfilling their fundamental obligation. CEOs have complete freedom to go beyond GAAP, and they absolutely should when it's necessary to give shareholders and creditors the full picture. The economic reality of a business can't always be captured in standardized accounting rules, and it's the CEO's job to bridge that gap with additional context and information."

You see, our operating managers will always deliver - that's not the question mark in our future. The real challenge for Charlie and me is whether we can effectively employ the funds that these businesses generate. That's why when we find a business like Borsheim's, with both excellent operations and trustworthy management, it's exactly the kind of step in the right direction we need.

So why should a CEO do the same to their real bosses - the shareholders? The business world is just too complex for a single set of rules to effectively describe economic reality for all enterprises. This is particularly true for companies like Berkshire that operate across many different businesses. What shareholders really need is information - whether it's GAAP, non-GAAP, or what I call extra-GAAP - that helps them answer three fundamental questions: what's the company worth, can it meet future obligations, and how well are the managers performing with what they've got?

And what's particularly troubling is how often their accountants are willing to help them game the system. You know the old joke - the client asks 'How much is two plus two?' and the cooperative accountant responds 'What number did you have in mind?' Now, I should point out that even honest and well-intentioned management teams sometimes stretch GAAP a bit to present figures they believe will better describe their performance. We see this in practices like earnings smoothing or taking a 'big bath' quarter - what I'd call 'white lie' techniques used by otherwise upright managers. But here's the key point: whether it's done with good intentions or not, when managers start viewing accounting standards as something to work around rather than work with, we're headed down a dangerous path. The purpose of financial reporting should be to help owners understand their business, not to obscure reality."

First, you have the honest managers who might stretch GAAP a bit - using techniques like earnings smoothing or the occasional 'big bath' quarter. They genuinely believe they're presenting a more accurate picture of their business. But then you have a more concerning group - the real charlatans who actively use GAAP to deceive. These folks know that investors, even the supposedly sophisticated ones, treat GAAP numbers like gospel. They find creative ways to technically comply with GAAP while presenting what's essentially an economic illusion. Why does this continue? Simple - as long as the market rewards steadily increasing earnings with high valuations, some managers will find ways to manufacture those numbers, regardless of the underlying reality. Charlie and I have seen accounting frauds of staggering size over the years. What's particularly troubling is that very few of these perpetrators face real consequences. As I've observed, it's been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun."

This meant we simply showed our equity in their combined net worth as a single entry on our balance sheet, and their combined earnings appeared as one line in our earnings statement. But under the new rules, we were required to fully consolidate all subsidiaries in both our balance sheet and earnings statement. Let me give you a specific example from our experience - Scott Fetzer Financial, which primarily handles financing for World Book and Kirby product sales, had to be reported differently under these new requirements. This change wasn't just about moving numbers around - it represented a different way of presenting the economic reality of our subsidiary relationships. While the underlying economics didn't change, the way we had to communicate them to shareholders did.

That's why at Berkshire, we only prepare consolidated figures because we have to meet outside requirements - it's not how Charlie and I actually analyze our businesses. What we really focus on is the segment data. That's where the real insights come from. Now, given that GAAP rules require us to bundle more numbers together - like we now have to do with Mutual Savings and Loan and Scott Fetzer Financial - we've made a decision to provide supplementary information that we believe will help investors better measure both business value and how well our managers are performing.

But now, the rules have changed. We're required to consolidate each and every asset and liability of these companies in our balance sheet, along with each item of their income and expense in our earnings statement. This change actually highlights a bigger issue - the critical importance of segmented data. When you're forced to combine more diverse business operations into conventional financial statements, those statements become less useful for investors trying to understand the true nature of the business. That's why Charlie and I put such emphasis on studying our segment data, and it's why we've decided to provide additional supplementary information that goes beyond just meeting GAAP requirements.

This kind of family commitment - where everyone is focused on what's right for the customer - creates a culture that's nearly impossible to replicate in a more corporate structure. It's exactly what we saw with the Blumkins too. When you find families who've built their success on deserving it - not through financial engineering or cutting corners, but through genuine customer service - that's the kind of business we want to partner with.

Yet customers barely make a peep. But in our insurance business, even when we raise prices just to match our rising costs, we face intense public outrage. It's really quite remarkable. Look at the market values - cereal companies trade at five times book value, while most large insurers sell close to book value. That tells you something about the relative economics of these businesses. As I like to quote Sam Goldwyn: 'In life, one must learn to take the bitter with the sour.'

When public resentment builds up, it often leads to political action that can severely impact our business operations. Take Proposition 103 in California - this initiative that passed is threatening to force auto insurance prices down dramatically, even though we're in an environment where our costs have been soaring. Now, while the courts are reviewing this and the price cuts are temporarily suspended, the underlying problem hasn't gone away - that deep-seated resentment from the public is still very much alive and active. This creates a challenging business environment where we're caught between rising costs on one side and regulatory pressure to lower prices on the other. The property-casualty insurance industry is already operating at subnormal profitability, and this trend is almost certain to continue - and probably accelerate - for at least two more years. When public sentiment turns against an industry, it can lead to regulatory actions that make an already challenging business environment even more difficult to navigate."

I like to explain this using our See's Candies business - if Proposition 103 applied to candy, we'd have to sell our bonbons at $5.76 per pound instead of $7.60, and we'd be losing money by the bucketful. Here's the fundamental reality: if voters insist that auto insurance be priced below cost, it eventually must be sold by government. That's just simple mathematics. Stockholders can subsidize policyholders for a short period, but only taxpayers can subsidize them over the long term. The market simply won't allow private companies to consistently sell dollar bills for 75 cents. And while this might not be catastrophic for many property-casualty companies due to their typically mediocre returns, it sets a dangerous precedent for the industry as a whole."

But what really concerns me isn't just California - it's the possibility that this kind of thinking could spread to other states through similar initiatives or legislation. The public's antagonism can have very real consequences on the ability to operate profitably. While the immediate direct effects on Berkshire are minor, since we didn't see many opportunities for profit in California's rate structure anyway, the broader implications are troubling. For most property-casualty companies, this might not be a disaster for shareholders because of the industry's commodity characteristics - they earn mediocre returns and have little economic goodwill to lose. But for well-run companies like GEICO, these politically-driven price controls can seriously impair their ability to serve customers while earning a reasonable return. When public sentiment drives pricing below economic reality, it's not just shareholders who ultimately lose - it's the entire private insurance market."

You see, we maintain an exceptional amount of float compared to our premium volume - about three times that of typical property/casualty companies. Mike Goldberg and his team, particularly Ajit Jain and Dinos Iordanou, have done a terrific job positioning us this way. Here's the interesting part: at some point - and we don't know exactly when - we're going to be deluged with insurance business. This might come from a major physical or financial catastrophe, or like in 1985, when other companies face large underwriting losses and realize they're underreserved. Until then, our strategy is straightforward: retain our talented professionals, protect our capital, and avoid major mistakes.

If you hire a secretary who needs to type 80 words per minute but can only manage 50, they'll be out quickly. Same with a sales person - if they don't bring in the orders, excuses won't save them. There's a clear, measurable standard. But with CEOs, it's a different ballgame entirely. First, there often aren't clear performance standards for the job. When standards do exist, they tend to be fuzzy or get explained away even after repeated failures. I've seen too many cases where the CEO essentially shoots the arrow first, then paints the bullseye around wherever it landed. Another crucial factor is that the CEO doesn't have an immediate superior who's being measured on their performance. A sales manager who keeps underperforming salespeople will face consequences themselves. But who measures the CEO? That's why we at Berkshire put such emphasis on having the right people in charge - we've been fortunate to work with managers of both talent and integrity."

Or in sales, the numbers tell the story - either you're bringing in sufficient business or you're not. Excuses don't generate orders. But here's where it gets interesting with CEOs: they operate in a kind of accountability vacuum. Unlike every other level in the organization, where someone's boss is being measured on how well they manage their team, the CEO has no immediate superior whose own performance is being measured. This creates what I call the supreme irony of business management - it's actually easier for an inadequate CEO to maintain their position than it is for an inadequate subordinate to keep theirs. And I've seen this pattern play out repeatedly, where underperforming CEOs continue in their roles despite clear evidence they don't belong in their jobs. That's why when Charlie and I find managers with real talent and integrity, we appreciate them enormously."

They've got skin in the game - their job depends on making those tough personnel decisions promptly. But here's the interesting part - the CEO answers to a Board of Directors that rarely measures its own performance and faces little real accountability for subpar corporate results. And let me tell you something about boards - they're generally not eager to rock the boat. At board meetings, criticizing the CEO is often treated like a social faux pas - as I like to say, it's viewed as the social equivalent of belching. Even in the worst-case scenario where poor performance leads to a takeover, board members typically walk away with generous benefits. As Charlie and I have observed over the years, this creates a fundamentally different dynamic than what you see at lower levels of the organization, where performance issues get addressed much more directly and swiftly."

And third, they demonstrate both integrity and ability in everything they do. These characteristics are particularly important because of the unique position CEOs occupy.

Because both society and our elected officials have too many competing priorities that simply don't align with maintaining purchasing-power stability. Now, you might notice we do hold some WPPSS bonds. That's a special case - many have short maturities or high coupons likely to be refunded soon. When we bought these, they were yielding about 17% after taxes with suspended ratings. They've since been upgraded to AA- by S&P and now trade near top-grade levels.

Some might call this scalping, but the practitioners preferred the fancier French term 'arbitrage.' Since World War I, though, we've seen the definition expand significantly. Today, what we call 'risk arbitrage' is much broader. It involves pursuing profits from announced corporate events - things like company sales, mergers, recapitalizations, reorganizations, liquidations, or self-tenders. The key difference is in the risk profile. In traditional arbitrage, you're dealing with minimal risk from tiny price discrepancies. In modern risk arbitrage, your main concern isn't really about the overall stock market behavior - instead, you're primarily betting on whether an announced event will actually happen. It's a different game entirely, and one that requires a different set of skills and analysis."

Fast forward to 1954, and we saw a temporary shortage of cocoa that drove the price up dramatically to over 60 cents. This created an unusual situation where Rockwood had this incredibly valuable inventory they wanted to unload quickly, before cocoa prices dropped again. But here was the catch - if they just sold the cocoa directly, they would have been hit with a nearly 50% tax on the proceeds. This kind of situation shows why you need to understand not just market dynamics, but also accounting principles and tax implications to spot these unique arbitrage opportunities. Sometimes the best opportunities come from these unusual circumstances where multiple factors - in this case, inventory accounting methods, commodity price spikes, and tax considerations - all intersect to create something special."

Third, you have to evaluate whether something even better might happen, like a competing takeover bid coming in higher. And fourth, you need to carefully consider what happens if the deal falls apart - whether due to anti-trust issues, financing problems, or other complications. You see, in recent years, many arbitrageurs have gotten a bit complacent because takeover activity has been rampant and anti-trust challenges have been almost non-existent. They've prospered without needing special talents - just by 'Being There,' as Peter Sellers would say. But that's dangerous thinking. As I like to say, referencing that Wall Street proverb: 'Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to arbitrage and you feed him forever.'

But what made this situation particularly intriguing was an additional factor that many might have overlooked. Arcata had this ongoing dispute with the U.S. Government over a land sale from 1978, where the government had taken 10,700 acres of their timber land - primarily old-growth redwood - to expand Redwood National Park. The government had paid $97.9 million for this acreage, but Arcata was contesting this as grossly inadequate. This situation perfectly illustrates why you need to look beyond just the basic merger terms when evaluating arbitrage opportunities. You've got the primary event - the KKR buyout - but then you've got this separate government dispute that could potentially add significant value. It's these kinds of multiple layers that can create especially attractive opportunities, but they also require more careful analysis of all the moving parts."

This case exemplifies our approach to arbitrage - we look for large, publicly announced situations where we can analyze the probabilities. We don't need dozens of positions; we're content to focus on a few significant opportunities where we understand the dynamics.

At Graham-Newman, I personally studied their arbitrage earnings from 1926 to 1956. The unleveraged returns averaged 20% per year. Then, when I started applying Ben Graham's arbitrage principles myself, first at Buffett Partnership and later at Berkshire, we continued to see returns well over 20%. Now, what makes this particularly interesting is that we weren't doing anything especially clever or secretive. We were simply acting on highly-publicized events, dealing with hundreds of different securities over this period. These weren't just a few lucky breaks - we had a clearly identified universe of arbitrage positions, and we didn't cherry-pick them in hindsight. During this same period, the general market returned just under 10% annually, including dividends. To put that in perspective, $1,000 would have grown to $405,000 at the market rate, but at our 20% rate, it would have become $97 million. That's what I call a statistically significant differential. If EMT were correct, this kind of consistent outperformance simply shouldn't be possible."

This wasn't a small sample size - we're talking about a broad range of investments across multiple decades. Second, and this is important, our results weren't skewed by just a few lucky hits. We had consistent performance across many, many trades. Third, we didn't need to become technical wizards or industry experts - we simply acted on highly-publicized events that anyone could see. No digging for obscure facts or developing special insights about products or management teams. Fourth, and this really drives the point home, our arbitrage positions were a clearly identified universe. We didn't go back and selectively pick the winners - these were all our positions, documented in real-time. I should mention that I was actually operating in a more favorable environment than Ben Graham did - he had to contend with 1929-1932, which wasn't exactly a picnic. But even with those challenging years included, the long-term performance speaks for itself."

But here's what's interesting: the proponents of EMT have never seemed interested in this kind of contradictory evidence. They keep teaching it at major business schools, and no one has ever admitted they were wrong, no matter how many thousands of students they've sent out with the wrong ideas. It's like a priesthood that refuses to demystify itself. But you know what? From a selfish perspective, this has been wonderful for us Graham followers. When you're in any kind of contest - whether it's financial, mental, or physical - it's an enormous advantage to have opponents who've been taught that it's useless to even try. Sometimes I think we Grahamites should probably endow chairs to keep EMT being taught forever!"

And here's something crucial that investors need to understand: you simply cannot obtain superior profits from stocks by just committing to a specific investment category or style. It's not like following a cookbook recipe. The market is more complex than that, and success requires careful analysis and judgment. You need to be prepared for periods when opportunities are scarce and maintain discipline in your approach.

You see, the key thing to understand is that you can't generate superior profits by simply committing to a specific investment category or style. That's not how it works. What really matters is careful evaluation of facts and continuous exercise of discipline. I often tell people that investing in arbitrage situations, by itself, is no better a strategy than selecting stocks by throwing darts.

We were fortunate to be assigned to Henderson Brothers, Inc. as our specialist - they're actually the oldest continuing specialist firm on the Exchange, with quite a history dating back to 1861 when William Thomas Henderson bought his seat for $500. They've done an excellent job for us, and as one of the largest specialist firms handling 83 stocks, they've proven to be a great partner. One important point I want to clarify that wasn't in our original shareholder letter - while our round lot for trading is ten shares, shareholders can actually trade any number of shares, even just one.

Think about it like this: if you're running a private business with partners, you want the value of their partnership interests to reflect the real economics of the business. That's exactly what we want for Berkshire shareholders. When our stock price consistently mirrors business value, each shareholder's investment results will roughly parallel Berkshire's actual business results during their holding period. We're actually bothered as much by significant overvaluation as by undervaluation. It might surprise some people, but we don't lose sleep trying to maximize the trading price like many other CEOs do. Our goal is simple - we want the stock to trade in a reasonable range around what the business is really worth, and hopefully that intrinsic value keeps growing at a good clip."

We're looking for long-term owners who plan to stay with us indefinitely. You know, I've never understood CEOs who want lots of stock activity in their shares. The only way you get that high trading volume is if many of your owners are constantly heading for the exits. That's not the kind of business we want to run. We prefer shareholders who view their Berkshire ownership the same way they'd view owning a private business - as a long-term partnership rather than a trading vehicle.

Think about it - would any church or school celebrate members constantly leaving? It's absurd. Though I suppose if there was a broker making commissions off church membership turnover, they might suggest 'There hasn't been much going on in Christianity for a while; maybe we should switch to Buddhism next week.' Through our policies, performance, and communications, we deliberately try to attract shareholders who understand our operations and share our long-term perspective. When we do have owners who need to sell, we want them to find good replacements who'll pay a fair price. But our main goal is being attractive to the right shareholders while remaining uninteresting to those with short-term or unrealistic expectations.

I can tell you directly that any long-time shareholder of Berkshire is appreciably wealthier because of Dave's influence on our company.

The principles he and Graham taught about focusing on business value and taking a long-term approach have been absolutely central to our success.

Look at his track record: no other investment teacher has produced as many successful students. I experienced this firsthand when I arrived at Columbia. Dave both encouraged and educated me, and both aspects were equally important. What's particularly impressive is that he continued teaching me through dozens of letters until his death. The principles he taught made perfect sense, and we've employed them directly at Berkshire. In fact, Charlie and I have built our prosperity on the intellectual foundation that Dave and Ben Graham established. I've known many finance professors over the years, but besides Ben Graham, I've never met anyone who could match Dave's abilities. The proof is in the pudding - just look at his own investment performance. He even outperformed Keynes, who had to convert to value investing after starting as a market-timer. Dave was right from the start, and Berkshire's success is truly the fruit of his intellectual tree."

He eventually converted to value investing after much consideration. Dave, on the other hand, was right from the beginning. He understood and applied the fundamental principles of value investing from the start. This is significant because it validates the entire approach he taught. I've known countless professors of finance and investments throughout my career, but I can tell you that only Ben Graham was Dave's equal. The remarkable thing about Dave was that he could both teach these principles effectively and implement them successfully in his own investing. This practical validation of his teaching is one reason why his students were so well-equipped to invest intelligently for a lifetime. At Berkshire, we've proven the enduring value of his approach by successfully applying these same principles in our investments."

The owners get to cash out a significant portion of their holding, which addresses their liquidity needs, while maintaining their leadership role and a meaningful ownership stake. We're happy to buy for cash, though we'll consider stock if we're receiving equivalent intrinsic business value. What's absolutely essential to understand is that we don't do unfriendly takeovers - period.
