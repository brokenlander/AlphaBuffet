The primary insurer keeps 5% of each layer, so they have a stake in each loss settlement. And if their coverage is exhausted, they can buy a second cover for the rest of the year by paying another premium. It's a way for us to provide protection while also making sure the primary insurer has some skin in the game."

It's like Newton's First Law of Motion - institutions resist change and tend to keep doing what they're doing, even if it's not the best course. I've also seen how this imperative can cause companies to mindlessly imitate their peers and pursue projects just because they have the funds available."

Charlie and I look for businesses with decent economic characteristics and leaders who are alert to these issues. Additionally, I've learned to only go into business with people I like, trust, and admire. It's not a guarantee of success, but it's a crucial starting point. After all, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but with the right people and a good business, you can accomplish wonders."
