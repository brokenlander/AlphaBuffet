But what really counts is intrinsic value, which represents what our businesses are rationally worth. Let me give you a concrete example from our own history: Back when Berkshire's book value was $19.46, the intrinsic value was actually lower because that book value was tied up in our textile business, which wasn't worth what the books said. Now, it's the opposite - most of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying values. You see, intrinsic value can be calculated by taking all future cash flows of a business - both incoming and outgoing - and discounting them at prevailing interest rates. When you look at it this way, all businesses, whether they're making buggy whips or cellular phones, can be compared on an equal economic footing. That's why I always emphasize that while book value is easier to calculate, it's intrinsic value that really matters for understanding what a business is worth."

At Berkshire, a large portion of our book value comes from equity securities that we carry at current market values on our balance sheet. At the end of 1989, these securities were trading at prices that were higher relative to their intrinsic business values than we've typically seen in the past. This happened for two reasons: First, we had a particularly buoyant stock market in 1989. But more importantly, the market widely recognized the fundamental virtues of these businesses. This situation requires careful attention because while we want to own excellent businesses, we also need to be mindful of the prices we pay relative to intrinsic value. When market prices get ahead of business values, it's something we watch very carefully. Remember, our goal isn't just to own good businesses - it's to own good businesses at the right price."

First, we've been fortunate that our portfolio companies have achieved exceptional gains in their intrinsic business value - that's the first dip. Then we got a second dip as the market finally recognized these companies' true worth and corrected their prices upward. You see, these wonderful businesses were once priced inappropriately low, but that's no longer the case. The market has caught up. Going forward, we'll still benefit from the good gains in business value that our companies will continue to make - I'm confident about that. But those 'catch-up' rewards, where the market adjusts from undervaluing to properly valuing our holdings, have already been realized. So we'll have to be content with a single-dip in the future. It's worth noting that we maintain our 'til-death-do-us-part' attitude with our major holdings regardless of their market prices. But when you combine this long-term holding approach with the full prices these companies now command, you simply can't expect them to drive Berkshire's value up as dramatically as they have in the past."

        "value": "This is really a fundamental law of nature that we can't escape. In a finite world, high growth rates must eventually self-destruct - it's just mathematics. I like to reference Carl Sagan's bacteria example here because it illustrates the point so clearly. He described bacteria that divide every 15 minutes - that's four doublings per hour and 96 doublings per day. Even though each bacterium weighs just a trillionth of a gram, after one day of this growth, you'd have a mass as heavy as a mountain. In two days, it would weigh more than the sun, and before long, everything in the universe would be bacteria! Now, when you're starting from a very small base, high growth rates can continue for a while without running into this mathematical wall. But as the base gets larger - as it balloons - the party has to end. The high growth rate eventually forges its own anchor. This has direct implications for us as investors. When we look at companies or even our own operations at Berkshire, we have to be realistic about growth rates. What might be possible when a business is small becomes mathematically impossible as it gets larger. That's why we have to constantly adjust our expectations and strategies as our base of operations grows."

They're essentially like an interest-free loan from the U.S. Treasury that we only have to pay back when we choose to - that is, when we sell the appreciated stock. It's quite a peculiar arrangement. The size of this 'loan' changes daily as market prices move up and down, and it can also change when tax rates are adjusted. But here's the key thing - this liability only becomes due when we decide to move from one asset to another. I sometimes think of it as a transfer tax. For instance, in 1989, we paid about $76 million in taxes when we sold some holdings with $224 million in gains. But as long as we maintain our position in a successful investment, we can defer that tax payment. This is why we prefer what I call the 'Rip Van Winkle' style of investing - buying great businesses and holding them for very long periods. The math of tax deferral works in our favor, and it's completely legal and logical when you think about it."

After paying the 34% capital gains tax each time, you'd end up giving about $13,000 to the government and keep around $25,250. Not a bad outcome. But here's where it gets interesting. Take the second approach - our preferred Rip Van Winkle style - where you make one fantastic investment that doubles 20 times over those same 20 years without any intermediate sales. That same dollar would grow to $1,048,576. When you finally cash out, you'd pay a 34% tax of about $356,500 and keep around $692,000. The difference is dramatic - about $692,000 versus $25,250. This mathematical edge comes from letting your money compound without interruption from tax payments. It's why we strongly prefer to buy wonderful businesses and hold them for very long periods. The less activity, the more our shareholders are likely to keep."

But that's actually not our main reason. Charlie and I have found that developing deep, lasting business relationships is both rare and incredibly rewarding. When we find great partners who run splendid businesses, we want to keep those relationships. Sure, we might be able to hop from investment to investment and squeeze out a bit more return - that's exactly what we did many years ago. But now we'd rather stick with people we know to be interesting and admirable rather than constantly seeking new relationships with others who are likely to be more average. I often say it's like marrying for money - that's usually a mistake if you're poor, and it's absolute insanity if you're already wealthy. We're quite comfortable sacrificing some theoretical maximum return to maintain these wonderful business partnerships that we know will still produce good results over time."

If you're frequently trading and paying taxes along the way, a dollar might grow to only $25 after taxes. But if you make one fantastic investment that compounds without interruption from tax payments, that same dollar could grow to over $1 million before taxes, leaving you with about $692,000 after paying the 34% tax at the end. The sole difference between these outcomes - a 27:1 ratio - is simply the timing of when you pay those taxes. The government actually benefits in the same proportion, collecting $356,500 versus just $13,000, though they do have to wait longer for their money in the second scenario. Now, while these mathematics are fascinating, I should emphasize that they aren't the primary reason for our long-term holding strategy. But they do demonstrate the powerful advantage of letting your money compound without interruption from tax payments."

Our 'look-through' approach means we add our share of the operating earnings retained by our investees to our own reported operating earnings. In 1989, for example, while we received about $45 million in dividends after taxes from our five major investees, our share of their retained earnings was actually about $212 million. Now, you might think we'd prefer to have that money in our hands, but here's why we're comfortable with this arrangement: these retained earnings are being deployed by exceptionally talented, owner-oriented managers who often have better uses for these funds in their own businesses than we would have in ours. I want to emphasize that I wouldn't make this assessment about most managements - but in these specific cases, it's absolutely true. It's what I call a 'bird-in-the-bush-may-be-worth-two-in-the-hand' situation.

Now, this isn't something we can do alone - we need significant help from our present investees. In fact, if you look at our current situation, our five major investees are crucial to this goal. But here's the important part: we also recognize that we need to add new investees from time to time to maintain this growth rate. It's like having a garden - you need your existing plants to keep growing, but you also need to plant new ones occasionally to maintain the overall yield. This is why we're always on the lookout for businesses with talented, owner-oriented managers who can effectively reinvest earnings. When we find such businesses, we're often better off letting them retain and reinvest earnings rather than paying them out as dividends. It's a strategy that has served us well with our current investees, and it's one we'll continue to pursue."

First, they concentrate all their operations in one location, which allows them to maintain an enormous selection across all price ranges. Now, this large-scale operation means they can keep their expense ratio to about one-third of what other comparable jewelry stores have. That's significant. When you combine this low expense structure with their exceptional buying power, they can offer prices that are substantially lower than other jewelers. And here's where the magic happens - these lower prices drive higher volume, which in turn increases their buying power and helps maintain that low expense ratio. It's a self-reinforcing cycle. The proof is in the numbers - we're seeing as many as 4,000 people on busy days. Just look at their growth: sales doubled in the six years before they moved to their current location, and now they're more than twice what they were four years ago. That's the power of a business model where every component strengthens the others."

As I've said, he's not only a superb businessman and a great showman, but also a man of integrity. Every surprise we've had since the purchase has been on the plus side. There's an old saying in the jewelry business: 'If you don't know jewelry, know your jeweler.' That wisdom applies whether you're buying a small diamond or, in our case, the whole business. Ike's character shows in everything he does - he's the managing genius behind Borsheim's success, and I mean that literally.

Because policies lasted one to three years, these changes took time to cycle through the system. It was like alternating current - the combined ratios would go up and down in a predictable pattern, but the industry as a whole remained consistently profitable. But that world is gone now. Today, we're looking at hundreds of companies all competing independently, selling what's essentially a commodity product. And I can tell you this - when you've got that kind of market structure, whether you're selling steel or insurance policies, you're going to see subnormal profitability most of the time. The only exception is when there's a shortage of capacity. That's just basic economics. The frequency and duration of these capacity shortages essentially determine the average profitability of the industry. It's a fundamentally different ballgame now, and anyone who doesn't understand this change is missing a crucial piece of the puzzle."

The industry has traditionally tried to regulate capacity in financial terms, using a formula that says a company should only write X dollars of business for Y dollars of net worth. Sounds logical, right? But here's the problem - it hasn't worked in practice. And I'll tell you why. The system lacks effective enforcement. You've got three groups who should theoretically act as watchdogs - regulators, insurance brokers, and customers. But all three have proven to be slow to discipline companies that push beyond their financial resources. It's like having a speed limit with no traffic cops - people will exceed it. This ineffective oversight means companies can and do stretch their capacity beyond what's prudent. The traditional financial constraints that should govern insurance capacity have become more theoretical than practical. This is a fundamental weakness in how the industry operates, and it's one reason why we see periods of excessive competition and underpricing."

The key thing to understand is that industry capacity fundamentally depends on the psychological state of insurance managers - their mental state, if you will. Now, you might think regulators and other watchdogs would keep things in check, but that's not what we see in practice. The reality is that regulators, brokers, and customers have consistently shown themselves to be quite slow in disciplining companies that push the limits of their resources. They tend to look the other way even when companies dramatically overstate their true capital position. What this means is that if a company wants to write a lot of business with very little capital backing it, they can generally find a way to do so. This leads directly to how profitability works in the industry. It's actually quite simple - good profits only materialize when there's a genuine shortage of capacity. And these shortages? They only occur when insurers get scared, which I can tell you doesn't happen very often. In fact, it's certainly not happening in the current market. It's a bit like watching a pendulum swing - the industry swings between fear and exuberance, and it's that psychological element, more than any regulatory constraint, that drives the cycles of profitability."

But they're missing the fundamental point here. These adversities, while certainly challenging, haven't done anything to dampen the industry's enthusiasm for writing business at current price levels. And that's the key factor. The industry keeps saying it needs higher prices to match the profitability of average American businesses. Well, sure it does - and so does the steel industry! But here's what I want you to understand: needs and desires have absolutely nothing to do with the long-term profitability of any industry. What matters are the economic fundamentals. The simple truth is that insurance profitability will only improve when we see virtually all insurers turning away business even when prices are higher. Until we reach that point - and we're nowhere near it right now - we won't see premium volume grow significantly enough to reverse the negative underwriting trend. It's just basic economics, and no amount of wishful thinking about catastrophes or tax impacts will change that reality."

When they can't find others to take pieces of these risks, they simply exit the market. At Berkshire, we take a completely different approach. When we see attractive rates, we're happy to keep all the risk ourselves. We can do this because of two key advantages we have: First, we have about $6 billion in regulatory net worth in our insurance operations - that's the second-highest in the United States. Second, and this is crucial, we simply don't care about quarterly or even annual earnings fluctuations. As long as we're making intelligent underwriting decisions, we're comfortable with the potential volatility.

Now, that's considerably more than we typically earn in a quarter, but here's the key point - it would only hurt our pride, not our fundamental financial strength. We approach these risks with our eyes wide open. We're willing to accept more reinsurance risk than any other company because we have the financial strength to absorb these potential losses, and we're not obsessed with short-term earnings.

I understand their thinking because what's best for owners isn't always best for managers worried about their jobs. But at Berkshire, we're willing to look foolish temporarily as long as we don't act foolishly. It's simple really - we can take the hit to our pride because we know it won't damage our fundamental well-being.

Second, and this is the real kicker, we generate substantial investment income from these policyholder funds. Looking ahead a few years, this combination should produce quite favorable insurance results for Berkshire.

What we do is continuously search among all of them for the highest after-tax returns based on mathematical expectation.

What we're focused on is maximizing long-term net worth. The insurance business gives us a favorable platform for this approach, particularly when we have substantial float like we do now.

I put money into street railway companies, windmill manufacturers, anthracite producers, textile businesses, and trading-stamp issuers instead. It wasn't until 1988 that we finally made our first significant investment, and by 1989 we had increased our position to 23,350,000 shares. The lesson here is that sometimes the best investments are hiding in plain sight, and we don't always act on obvious opportunities as quickly as we should. As I like to say with a bit of self-deprecating humor, this demonstrates the incredible speed with which your Chairman responds to investment opportunities, no matter how obscure or well-disguised they may be."

The market values range from $161 million to over $1.8 billion, with Coca-Cola being our largest position at that time. What's particularly telling is that this list remained exactly the same as the previous year, with only one change - we increased our Coca-Cola holdings from 14,172,500 shares to 23,350,000 shares. This demonstrates our philosophy of concentrated investing in businesses we understand and believe in. We're not interested in having dozens of small positions just for the sake of diversification. When we find companies with strong fundamentals and excellent prospects, we're willing to make substantial investments and hold them for the long term. Take our Coca-Cola position - once we finally recognized it as a superior investment opportunity, we didn't hesitate to make it our largest holding. The same goes for our other investments like GEICO, where we turned a $45 million investment into over $1 billion in market value. This approach might seem overly concentrated to some, but when you understand a business and its intrinsic value, there's no need to dilute your returns with lesser opportunities."

When you see a wonderful business with great management and compelling economics, the time to act is now, not decades later. I've learned that waiting too long on a clearly good opportunity can be just as costly as making a hasty bad investment. The quality of the business and its management were apparent - we just needed to move faster on the recognition of that fact. But I will say that even when we did finally invest in Coca-Cola, it proved to be an extraordinary investment for us, which really underscores the value of great businesses, even if you're a bit late to recognize them."

That's why we need more than just the preferred stock yield, especially since typical preferred stocks hold no appeal for us whatsoever. We structure these investments so that we only win if the other shareholders win. Take Gillette under Colman's management - we believe they'll exceed the returns of American industry in general.

The attraction for these junk issuers was simple and rather clever - you can't default on a promise to pay nothing. Think about it - if the Latin American countries had issued only long-term zero-coupon bonds in the 1970s, they'd have a perfect credit record today. Not because they were good credits, mind you, but because they wouldn't have had to pay anything yet.

Free cash flow, as we define it, means operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization, minus the normal capital expenditures you need to maintain the business. But then the deal fever took hold. You could see the adrenaline levels rising among the deal-makers, and suddenly businesses were being purchased at prices so high that every single dollar of free cash flow had to go toward interest payments. Nothing left for debt reduction, nothing for reinvestment. When you reach that point, you're not really running a business anymore - you're running a high-wire act.

Nothing left for paying down principal. It was like they adopted Scarlett O'Hara's philosophy of 'I'll think about it tomorrow' when it came to actually repaying the debt. The whole mindset shifted from debt being something you pay off to something you just refinance. It reminds me of that New Yorker cartoon where the borrower tells the banker 'I don't know how I'll ever repay you' - except in these cases, they weren't even joking.

But here's the key point: some variations of these instruments have far more potential for mischief than others. The real danger comes from zero-coupon issuers who can't make their interest payments on a current basis. When you see that situation, combined with investment bankers talking up EBDIT or creating capital structures where current cash flow can't comfortably cover all interest payments - well, that's when you should zip up your wallet tight. Here's a simple test I like to suggest: ask the promoters and their high-priced entourage to accept zero-coupon fees, deferring their own compensation until those zero-coupon bonds are paid in full. It's amazing how quickly enthusiasm for these deals can evaporate when you put it that way. The truth is, financial alchemy often makes the promoter rich, but it's usually the gullible investors, not actual business achievements, that are the source of that wealth."

Just as a good bartender knows when to cut off someone who's had too much to drink to prevent them from causing harm on the highway, bankers should exercise similar judgment with financial products. The problem is that promoters throughout history have shown about as much restraint in taking money as alcoholics have shown with liquor. What we've seen, particularly in recent years, is that many leading investment firms have decided that even this basic 'bartender morality' is too restrictive for them. They're willing to keep serving up risky products to make a profit, regardless of the consequences. I've noticed that those taking the high road on Wall Street haven't had much company lately. It's particularly troubling when you look at cases like certain savings and loan associations that bought risky zero-coupon bonds with FSLIC-insured deposits. When these investments worked, the owners kept the profits. When they failed - and many did - the taxpayers got stuck with the bill. As I like to quote from Jackie Mason, at these associations it was the managers who should have been wearing the ski masks."

This is particularly important in business and investing where the stakes are high and the same patterns tend to repeat themselves. When I look back at our first twenty-five years, for instance, we made plenty of mistakes worth examining. The key isn't just to acknowledge these mistakes happened, but to really understand them so we can avoid similar pitfalls in the future. Experience might not be a perfect teacher, but it's still one of the best we've got. The important thing is to approach this review process with honesty and humility, recognizing that even seasoned investors and business people can and do make mistakes. The goal isn't to dwell on past errors, but to use them as stepping stones to better decision-making in the future."

Think of it like finding a discarded cigar butt on the street - it may have only one puff left, but if you got it for virtually nothing, that last puff is all profit. In my early years, this worked reasonably well. You'd buy a stock at such a low price that when there was some temporary uptick in the business's fortunes, you could sell it for a decent profit, even if the underlying business was terrible. But I've learned this is a foolish way to buy businesses unless you're a liquidator. Here's why: First, what seems like a bargain price often isn't such a steal after all. In troubled businesses, problems keep surfacing - as I like to say, there's never just one cockroach in the kitchen. Second, any initial advantage gets eaten away by the poor returns these businesses generate. If you buy something for $8 million that could be liquidated for $10 million, that's fine if you act quickly. But if it takes ten years to get that $10 million while earning tiny returns along the way, you've actually made a poor investment. That's why I moved away from this approach at Berkshire."

This exemplifies a crucial lesson about value investing: just because something is cheap doesn't make it a good investment. The experience taught me that focusing solely on price while ignoring business quality is a fundamental error. When I bought Berkshire, I was already becoming aware that my strategy of buying statistically cheap stocks wasn't ideal, but I made the purchase anyway. The key lesson here is that experience alone isn't enough - you have to actually learn from it and change your approach. In difficult businesses like textiles, solving one problem just leads to another surfacing. The low returns these businesses generate will eventually erode any initial price advantage you might have secured. This experience helped shape my evolution from looking for cheap purchases to focusing on high-quality businesses that can generate good returns over the long term, even if the initial purchase price might seem higher. It's better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price."

If you can sell it quickly, you'll get a nice return. But if that same business only earns a few percent on cost annually and you sell it for $10 million after ten years, you've actually had a poor investment. I learned this lesson personally with Hochschild Kohn, a Baltimore department store I bought through Diversified Retailing. On paper, it looked like a can't-miss deal - I bought at a discount to book value, it had great people, unrecorded real estate values, and a LIFO inventory cushion. But three years later, I was lucky to get out at roughly my purchase price. The fundamental principle here is that a mediocre business doesn't magically become better just because you bought it cheaply. Time will expose its weaknesses, while a truly wonderful business gets stronger with each passing year."

You see, I used to be attracted to what looked like bargains - businesses selling below book value or with other apparent discounts. But what I've learned is that focusing too much on price while compromising on business quality is a classic mistake. It's like the lesson about jockeys and horses - good jockeys will do well on good horses, but not on broken-down nags. That's why today, when we're looking at either companies to acquire or common stocks to buy, we prioritize finding first-class businesses run by first-class managements. The price has to be reasonable, of course, but we won't sacrifice quality for price. Those bargain-basement deals I chased in my earlier years might have seemed smart at the time, but they taught me that a great business at a fair price will outperform a mediocre business at a great price every time."

Both had excellent, honest people running them, and these same managers would have achieved terrific results if they'd been in charge of businesses with good economic characteristics. But they were essentially running in quicksand. You see, when a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it's the reputation of the business that remains intact. I've unfortunately been quite energetic in creating examples of this principle - as Mae West said, 'I was Snow White, but I drifted.' The fundamental economics of the business will always trump management skill.

Let me give you some specific ways it shows up. First, organizations tend to resist any change in direction - just like Newton's First Law of Motion. Second, if there's money available, companies will find ways to spend it, whether through projects or acquisitions. Third - and this is particularly interesting - if a leader has a business idea, no matter how foolish, their team will quickly produce detailed studies to justify it. And fourth, companies tend to mindlessly copy what their peers are doing, whether it's expanding, acquiring, or setting executive compensation. Now, what's fascinating is that this isn't usually due to stupidity or bad intentions - it's just institutional dynamics at work. After making some costly mistakes by ignoring this force, I've deliberately structured Berkshire to minimize its influence. It's like a corporate version of gravity - it's always there, whether you acknowledge it or not, and you have to actively work to counteract it."

I've found that the reverse is also absolutely true - we won't partner with managers who lack admirable qualities, even if their business looks incredibly promising on paper. You see, in all our years of doing deals, we've never once succeeded in making a good deal with a bad person. It's that simple.

That said, I should note that being consistently conservative in our financial policies, while it might appear to have been a mistake to some, has served us well in my view.
