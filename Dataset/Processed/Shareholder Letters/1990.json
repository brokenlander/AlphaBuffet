When you're dealing with numbers that large, maintaining percentage growth becomes increasingly difficult. Look at our track record - we've managed a 23.2% compound annual growth rate over 26 years, which took us from $19.46 per share to $4,612.06. That's wonderful, but it's unrealistic to expect those kinds of returns to continue indefinitely as our base grows. That's why we've set a more modest target of 15% average annual gain in intrinsic value. And even that becomes more challenging each year. It's like trying to steer an ever-larger ship - the bigger it gets, the harder it is to maintain the same nimbleness and speed. That's why I always tell our shareholders that past performance, whether it's our 26-year record or even our one-year results, is meaningless in forecasting future results. We'll keep working toward that 15% goal, but we need to be realistic about the headwinds that come with size."

In 1990, we saw some significant price movements in these holdings. The two media companies - Capital Cities/ABC and Washington Post - experienced price declines, and these weren't just random market fluctuations. They were tied to what I called 'evolutionary industry developments' that actually justified lower valuations. On the flip side, Coca-Cola's stock price increased significantly, and again, I believed there were good fundamental reasons for that appreciation. But here's the important point - even after these price movements, none of these stocks were what I'd call 'enticing' in terms of valuation, though they were somewhat more appealing than a year earlier. Remember, these are all companies with fine businesses and superb managements. But as I've always said, even great companies can be poor investments if you pay too much for them. That's why we're constantly evaluating not just the quality of the business and management, but also the relationship between price and value."

        "value": "Well, this is an important point that I never tire of explaining. You see, even if Berkshire achieves our 15% target gain in intrinsic value, an individual shareholder's returns can be quite different depending on the premium or discount to intrinsic value at which they buy and sell. Let me give you a specific example from the text: If you buy Berkshire at a 10% premium to intrinsic value, and we grow intrinsic value at 15% annually, and then you later sell at that same 10% premium, you'll achieve that same 15% compound return. But - and this is crucial - if you buy at a premium and sell at a smaller premium, your results will be inferior to the company's results. That's precisely why Charlie and I prefer Berkshire's stock to trade consistently around intrinsic value. We don't like the kind of volatility we saw in 1989-1990, where the market price swung wildly despite more modest changes in intrinsic value. It's in everyone's best interest for the stock price to reasonably track the growth in intrinsic value over time."

Even Charlie and I, who've been working together for many years and think very similarly about business value, might differ by as much as 10% in our personal appraisals of Berkshire's intrinsic value. That's perfectly normal and acceptable. What we do know with certainty is that Berkshire's intrinsic value continues to exceed our book value by a substantial margin. But we can't tell you the exact differential because it's not that kind of precise measurement. Think about our goal of 15% average annual gain in intrinsic value - that's becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as our equity base grows larger. We're now working with a $5.3 billion equity base, and as any of you who've studied business know, size can be an anchor on growth rates. The key is to understand that while we can't pinpoint intrinsic value to the dollar, we can make reasonable estimates that guide our decision-making and help us measure our progress toward our long-term goals."

The key thing to understand is that we own some truly exceptional businesses that are worth considerably more than what shows up on our books. A lot of this extra value - and this is important - has been created by the outstanding managers running these operations. The accounting doesn't capture the full value of these businesses or the talent of these managers. It's similar to trying to value a great artist by the cost of their paint and canvas - the true value lies in what they create with those tools.

The truth is that some significant American fortunes have actually been built by turning accounting illusions into cold, hard cash. This isn't a new problem either. My mentor Ben Graham was writing satires about accounting tricks back in 1936, and sadly, we're still seeing similar shenanigans today in major corporations, often with big-name auditors signing off on them. What investors need to understand is that accounting numbers should be the starting point, not the finish line, in calculating true economic earnings. You've got to dig deeper and keep your guard up.

But if you looked at Berkshire's GAAP earnings, you'd only see about $530,000 of that - that's what we received in dividends after taxes. The rest of those earnings stayed with Capital Cities, but they're still very real to us as owners. This happens with many of our investee companies - they earn far more than they pay out in dividends, and accounting rules only let us record what we receive in dividends. So when you're looking at Berkshire's reported earnings, you're not seeing the full picture of the economic value being created for our shareholders.

While only about $530,000 shows up in our GAAP earnings from the dividends they pay us, our actual share of their earnings was over $83 million. That additional $82 million stays with Cap Cities as retained earnings. Now, some folks get hung up on the fact that this doesn't appear in our reported earnings, but that's entirely missing the point. I've always said we care about who owns the tree and what's done with it, not whether the auditors hear it fall in the forest. These retained earnings are still working for our benefit, even if they're not on our books. The key is ownership and utilization - how these earnings are being deployed to create value. When a wonderful business like Coca-Cola uses retained earnings to repurchase shares, that increases our ownership percentage in what I consider the most valuable franchise in the world. That's far more important than how it's reflected in accounting statements."

When Coke retains earnings and uses them for share repurchases, they're increasing our percentage ownership in the company directly. Now, they could alternatively pay those same funds to us as dividends, and we could turn around and use that money to buy more Coke shares ourselves. But here's the catch - that would be far less efficient because we'd have to pay taxes on those dividends first. That means we'd have less capital to reinvest, and consequently couldn't increase our proportionate ownership to the same degree that Coke can when acting on our behalf. Yes, if we followed that less efficient dividend-and-repurchase route, Berkshire would report higher earnings on paper. But that's exactly why I advocate looking at our results on a 'look-through' basis - taking our share of retained earnings from investees (about $250 million), subtracting the taxes we would've paid on dividends (around $30 million), and adding that net amount to our reported operating earnings. This gives a much clearer picture of our true economic performance."

This gave us look-through earnings of about $590 million in 1990. You see, the standard accounting method doesn't capture the full economic reality of our ownership in these businesses. When companies we own, like Coca-Cola, retain earnings and reinvest them efficiently on our behalf, that creates real value for Berkshire even though it doesn't show up in conventional earnings. We aim to grow these look-through earnings by about 15% annually, though we won't always hit that target. For instance, in 1991, we'll fall short partly due to our Gillette preferred conversion and declining media earnings. But I believe this look-through approach gives shareholders the clearest picture of our true earnings power."

When our investee companies, like Coca-Cola, retain and reinvest earnings directly, they can compound our ownership stake more efficiently than if they paid dividends to Berkshire first. Here's why: If they paid us dividends, we'd immediately lose a portion to taxes before we could reinvest. This means we wouldn't be able to increase our proportionate ownership to the same degree that companies like Coke can when they reinvest directly on our behalf. Now, it's interesting to note that if we did receive all those dividends, Berkshire would actually report far greater earnings under conventional accounting. But that would be misleading because we'd have less actual wealth-creating power due to the tax drag. This is why we focus on look-through earnings rather than reported earnings - it better reflects the economic reality of our ownership stakes. The key is having great businesses reinvest their earnings intelligently while avoiding an extra layer of taxation that would reduce our compounding power."

You know, it reminds me a lot of what Sam Walton built at Wal-Mart with their 15% operating costs. It's the same principle whether you're selling diapers or diamonds - when you can operate at significantly lower costs, you can offer better prices that your competitors simply can't match. These lower prices drive higher volume, which then allows us to carry an inventory that's about ten times larger than typical jewelry stores. It's a virtuous cycle. The bigger we get, the more advantages we develop. Think about it - better prices lead to more volume, more volume lets us carry more selection, and more selection brings in more customers.

This kind of family commitment creates an atmosphere where everyone has skin in the game. They're not watching the clock waiting for 5 o'clock - they're focused on building something lasting. That's why we can run circles around competitors who have managers just putting in their hours. When you have multiple generations working together, sharing the same values and commitment to customer service, it creates a culture that's impossible for corporate competitors to replicate.

Advertising dollars are growing more slowly than before, and we're seeing those dollars get dispersed across a much wider array of channels, both print and electronic.

We're also seeing retailers who don't use traditional media advertising taking market share in various merchandise categories. All of these factors combine to reduce the intrinsic value of media businesses. Now, let me be clear - these are still fine businesses, and they remain economic marvels compared to American industry generally.

But I'll give you my judgment anyway: these businesses are experiencing a fundamental shift. The traditional resilience we've come to expect from media businesses during economic downturns appears to be weakening. This isn't just about the cycle - it's about structural changes in how advertising dollars flow through the economy. When you combine slower advertising growth with the proliferation of advertising channels and changing retail patterns, you're looking at a different business environment than what we've seen historically.

The interesting thing is that insurance managers tend to respond rather slowly to this reality. They keep writing business at inadequate prices - what I call 'digging the hole deeper.' Now, you might wonder why they continue doing this. The reality is that most managers won't change course until the pain becomes severe enough to create real fear in the marketplace. And sometimes the true severity of the situation is masked because companies tend to under-reserve when business turns bad. It's like that old saying I mentioned - the most important thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.

First, we have a structural advantage - our primary property insurance business is relatively small, so we don't have to worry about correlation between regular property losses and super-cat losses hitting us at the same time. But more fundamentally, Charlie and I have always believed that our shareholders can handle volatility if they understand the long-term economics. Look, we've always preferred a lumpy 15% return to a smooth 12%. Most corporate managers think their shareholders hate volatility, but we believe Berkshire shareholders, if properly informed, can handle unusual swings in profits as long as the underlying economics make sense over time. Our yearly combined ratio in super-cat will typically be close to either zero or 300% - there's rarely anything in between. Most insurers simply can't or won't tolerate those kinds of swings. But we're built differently, both in terms of our financial capacity and our willingness to accept short-term volatility for superior long-term results."

First, while we expect satisfactory results over a decade or so, we know with certainty that we'll have some absolutely terrible years along the way. That's just the nature of super-cat insurance. Second, we have to be humble about our ability to price this risk. We can't rely much on historical loss data when setting today's rates - it's largely a matter of subjective judgment. This isn't like regular insurance where you have decades of reliable statistics to work from. And third - this is crucial - we'll only write this business at prices we believe truly reflect the risks involved. If our competitors get optimistic and start underpricing policies, we're perfectly happy to see our volume fall. In fact, this business has been woefully underpriced in recent years, and we've seen many competitors leave the field on stretchers, so to speak. We don't play that game. We maintain our discipline and wait for appropriate pricing. That's why our volume can vary significantly from year to year, and we're completely comfortable with that."

This lengthy delay means we can earn investment returns on that float for many years. Because of these investment earnings, a combined ratio of 115 or even higher might seem profitable initially, since the investment income can more than offset the 15% by which claims and expenses exceed premiums. But here's the catch, and it's a big one: In long-tail business, what starts as a 115 combined ratio can spiral to 200 or 300 or even worse by the time all claims are finally settled years or decades later. The initial numbers are often a mirage. Societal trends and inflation have a way of making those distant claims far more expensive than initially projected. That's why targeting ratios like 110-115 is, as I call it, business suicide. You need a much larger margin of safety built into your pricing to handle the inevitable surprises that time will bring."

This happens for two key reasons that I've observed: First, there's often a very long delay between when the alleged wrongdoing occurs and when claims are actually filed - think about a medical error that might not be discovered for years. Second, once claims are filed, they frequently get tied up in lengthy litigation, further extending the time before any payment is made. That's why we call it 'long-tail' business in the industry - because there's this extended period where we're holding onto substantial sums that will eventually go to the claimants and various lawyers involved. But remember, this seemingly attractive float characteristic comes with significant risks. The longer the tail, the more uncertainty there is about the ultimate cost of claims. That's why we need to be extremely careful about how we price this business, even though the float looks tempting."

But when you examine this ratio over several years, it tells you something very valuable: the true cost of the funds your insurance operations are generating. It's really quite simple - if you have a low cost of funds, you've got yourself a good business. If that cost is high, well, you're in a poor business. We've been tracking this metric since we first entered the insurance business, and it's proven to be a much more reliable indicator of long-term profitability than the combined ratio alone."

When we price our policies, we're not just looking to break even or make a small profit. We need to build in enough cushion to absorb those expensive surprises that society throws our way.

Now, this is quite good because in 19 out of 24 years, we've managed to get funds at a cost below what the government pays. But here's the important part - you can't just look at the raw numbers. You need to consider two crucial factors. First, insurance is a long-tail business. We won't know our true cost of float from 1967-1990 until all claims are settled, which could be decades from now. Second - and this is something many people overlook - there's a tax penalty that effectively increases the cost of float. For shareholders, the double taxation on investment income from insurance operations adds about one percentage point to the cost of float. When you put all this together, calculating the cost of funds gives you a clear picture of whether an insurance operation is creating or destroying value for shareholders. It's like having a measuring stick for the true economics of the business."

Direct investments would be more tax-efficient - that's just a fact. We've done the math on this, and while it's not a precise calculation, we estimate that for the average insurance company, this tax penalty adds about one percentage point to their cost of float. That's roughly the same for Berkshire. Now, this doesn't mean insurance float is a bad thing - after all, we've managed to develop funds at a cost below government rates in 19 out of 24 years. But it's important for shareholders to understand that this tax inefficiency is a real cost that affects their returns.

It's like running a bank that pays more interest on its deposits than it earns on its loans - that's not a business you want to be in. Now, when you find an operation where the cost of float is lower than alternative funding sources, that's when you've got something valuable. At Berkshire, we've been fortunate to fall into what I call the significantly-lower camp. GEICO is an even better example - they typically operate at an underwriting profit, which means their cost of float is actually less than zero. Their policyholders are effectively paying us to hold their money. But I should emphasize - GEICO can do this because they're extraordinarily efficient and very smart about classifying risks, which allows them to offer very competitive prices to customers.

These companies are vulnerable to catastrophic events that could exceed their reinsurance protection and, as I like to say, take their cost of float right off the chart. Now, you might think these companies could simply improve their underwriting performance to solve these problems. But history tells us that's an almost impossible task - it's like trying to turn that bank we talked about earlier, the one paying more on deposits than it earns on loans, into a profitable operation. The math just doesn't work. Unless they can achieve the kind of operational efficiency we see at companies like GEICO, with careful risk classification and rock-bottom operating costs, they're likely to keep delivering subpar results to their shareholders."

Float is like getting a loan, but whether it's a good loan depends entirely on the terms. In the insurance industry, many companies are paying too much for their float through poor underwriting performance. It's similar to a bank that pays higher interest on deposits than it earns on loans - that's obviously a formula for losing money. We've been fortunate at Berkshire because we've generally maintained a reasonable cost of float. Now, our shareholders do incur some extra taxes because of how insurance accounting works, but the benefits have more than compensated for these costs. But here's the key thing to remember - catastrophic losses can take that cost of float right off the chart. Unless an insurance company can maintain disciplined underwriting - and history shows that's incredibly difficult - shareholders will suffer. The insurance business has treated us very well because we've managed both sides of the equation: keeping our cost of float reasonable while earning good returns on those funds. But it requires constant vigilance, and as I've learned through some colossal mistakes, there's no statute of limitations on stupidity in this business."

Second, the business has remarkable scalability when done right. However, I should emphasize that this potential comes with considerable risks. I learned this the hard way through some major mistakes before Mike Goldberg came aboard, and we're still paying bills for some of those errors years later. That's a peculiar aspect of insurance - your mistakes can have very long tails. But despite these periodic challenges, I remain convinced that our insurance operation is worth far more than its carrying value on our books. The key is understanding that while the business can be unforgiving of mistakes, it also offers unique opportunities for creating value that simply aren't available in most other industries.

We've watched bankers follow each other like lemmings in their lending practices, and now they're suffering lemming-like consequences.

Third, and this is really important - they maintain rigorous cost discipline regardless of how well the business is doing. They don't let success make them complacent.

You see, at Berkshire, we're going to be buying businesses - or small parts of businesses through stocks - year in and year out, as long as I'm alive and even longer. So why would we want higher prices? It's completely illogical for long-term investors to become euphoric when stock prices rise and unhappy when they fall.

But when it comes to stocks, these same people somehow flip their thinking - they become euphoric when prices rise and despondent when they fall. This makes no sense if you're a long-term investor. At Berkshire, we maintain the same logical approach whether we're buying newsprint for the Buffalo News or acquiring businesses and stocks. We know we're going to be perpetual buyers - in fact, we'll be buying businesses year in and year out as long as I'm around and even after that. So we welcome opportunities to buy at lower prices. This isn't just theory - we put this into practice when Wells Fargo's stock dropped 50% in 1990. Instead of panicking, we saw it as a chance to acquire more shares at better prices.

Sure, that driver would be alert, but they'd also be guaranteed to have a fatal accident at the first small bump in the road. And let me tell you, in business, there are bumps everywhere. What we witnessed in 1990 was exactly this - companies failing left and right because they had no margin for error. I remember one particularly foolish case in Tampa where someone bought a TV station with so much debt that the interest payments were actually higher than the station's total revenues. That's like buying a restaurant where you'd need to sell more meals than you have seats, even if all your food and labor were free. It's a mathematical impossibility. The fundamental problem is that these debt structures leave no room for the inevitable challenges that every business faces. When you pile on debt to that degree, you're not creating discipline - you're creating a structure that's destined to fail even with good business performance."

When investors ignored this principle going into the 1990s, they suffered staggering losses. The margin of safety concept is really about preparing for reality rather than hoping everything goes perfectly. Look at what happened in 1990 - even before the recession hit, we saw numerous corporations failing because they had no buffer, no margin of safety. They'd structured themselves in ways that required everything to go right, which in business is a fantasy. I've always believed that a good investment approach is one that can withstand problems, because problems are inevitable. When Graham talked about margin of safety, he was telling us to build in room for error, to plan for the potholes we'll inevitably hit on the business highway. It's not about being pessimistic - it's about being realistic and ensuring survival under less-than-ideal conditions."

You see, when we invested in USAir, I made what I'd call an 'unforced error' - nobody pushed me into it, I just made a mistake in timing. The industry economics deteriorated at an alarming pace, largely because when you're selling essentially the same product as everyone else - in this case, airline seats - one irrational competitor can bring down the whole industry's profitability through destructive pricing. Even if you're running the best operation, like USAir was doing with excellent service marks, you can't escape the gravitational pull of industry economics. That's why it's so crucial to evaluate not just the company you're investing in, but also the behavior of all players in a commodity industry.

They resolved the operational problems rather quickly, and the airline achieved excellent marks for service after the initial turbulence. But here's the key point - even when management successfully handles the internal merger challenges, as USAir did, you're still not out of the woods. The broader industry conditions can swamp even the best execution of a merger integration. That's exactly what happened here - while USAir fixed its internal issues, the industry's economics deteriorated so severely that it overshadowed the operational improvements. So while good management can solve company-specific problems, they can't control industry-wide factors.

Using that logic, you'd have to conclude that a non-convertible preferred would be worth zero, which is clearly wrong. The reality is that most of the value in our convertible preferreds comes from their fixed-income characteristics - the steady dividend payments and redemption terms. Think of it this way: a convertible preferred has a floor value based on its worth as a straight preferred stock. The conversion feature is like a bonus option on top of that. So these securities can never be worth less than their value as non-convertible preferreds, and they might be worth more thanks to the conversion option. It's important to understand both components rather than focusing solely on the conversion feature."

What makes us unique is our approach to management after the acquisition. Take our preferred model - the Blumkin-Friedman-Heldman type deals. In these cases, we're dealing with owner-managers who want to generate significant cash, either for themselves or their families, but also want to keep running their companies just as they have in the past.

When I chose Ken to run our textile operation back in 1965, it wasn't just about managing assets - it was about having someone who would be 100% straight with me and who could generate the funds that allowed us to diversify into insurance. That same principle of prioritizing character and long-term thinking over pure financial considerations guides our estate planning today.

I'm particularly concerned about the role of brokers in these situations. Their incentive is simply to get the deal done because that's how they get paid.

When a larger company acquires your business, they typically come with their own squad of managers who have been waiting in the wings, often promised the opportunity to run future acquisitions. Now, here's the interesting part - even if your business has been performing exceptionally well, better than theirs in fact, these managers will inevitably believe their methods are superior. It's just human nature. I've seen this through the experiences of many friends who've sold their businesses. The parent company, especially when they think they know the industry, will start applying what they call 'hands-on help.' They make promises about letting you run things, but sooner or later, they want to implement their own way of doing things. It's like having a backseat driver who eventually wants to take the wheel, regardless of how well you've been driving. The larger the acquiring company, the more likely this is to happen because they've got these teams of managers who need to justify their existence by making changes, whether needed or not."

        "value": "Let me tell you about these financial maneuverers - they're a different breed altogether from strategic buyers. Their playbook is pretty consistent: they operate with large amounts of borrowed money, and their primary goal is to flip the business - either back to the public markets or to another corporation - as soon as market conditions look favorable. They're not interested in running the business long-term. One of their favorite tricks - and we're seeing this more and more in today's market environment - is to make cosmetic changes to accounting methods. They do this to make earnings look as attractive as possible right before they head for the exits. This type of transaction has become increasingly common for two main reasons: we've got a rising stock market and there's an abundance of funds available for these deals. Now, if you're a business owner whose only goal is to cash out and walk away - and believe me, there are plenty who fit this description - then this type of buyer might suit your purposes. But let's be clear about what's happening: these aren't operators looking to build something; they're financial engineers looking for a quick flip."

        "value": "Well, what makes us quite different is that we buy to keep, but we do it with a unique philosophy. You see, we don't have - and we don't plan to have - operating people at our parent organization. When we acquire a business, we take an approach that's really quite unusual in the corporate world. The businesses we own operate autonomously to an extraordinary degree. In fact, I'll tell you something interesting - many of the managers of our important businesses haven't even been to Omaha or met each other, even after years of ownership. We don't try to change the way these businesses operate. Instead, we adapt to their methods. This is fundamentally different from other buyers who might bring in their own management teams or try to integrate the business into their existing operations. We don't have any recently recruited MBAs or family members waiting in the wings to run these businesses, and we're not going to change that approach. It's worked well for us. You can actually verify this - I encourage people to check with anyone we've bought a business from, particularly those whose businesses faced challenges, to see how we lived up to our promises."

That's perfectly fine, and in those cases, any type of buyer might be suitable. But here's the key point - there's another type of seller, one whose business represents the creative work of a lifetime and forms an integral part of their personality and sense of being. For these sellers, most conventional buyers have serious flaws. You see, when a business is that personally meaningful to someone, our approach at Berkshire becomes particularly relevant. We understand that these businesses aren't just assets on a balance sheet - they're lifetime achievements. That's why our model of letting owners continue to run their businesses, maintaining their culture and operating methods, becomes so important. We're not going to come in and dismantle what they've built or try to remake it in our image. This understanding of the emotional investment some sellers have in their businesses is crucial to why we structure our acquisitions the way we do."

        "value": "Well, our philosophy is really quite simple on this. I get involved in just three key areas: capital allocation, selecting the top person, and determining their compensation. Beyond that, we leave the operating decisions to the managers who've been running these businesses successfully. Look, some of our managers like to talk things over with me, and others prefer to run things independently. That's perfectly fine - it really depends on their personality and the relationship we develop. We don't try to micromanage or change what's already working. When we buy a business, we're buying it because of its excellent management. That's why we insist on key managers retaining ownership - typically around 20% while we take 80% for tax consolidation purposes. We need that ownership structure, but more importantly, we need those managers to stay passionate about their business. You can't create that with contracts; it has to come from a genuine desire to keep building the business. That's why we rely on a manager's word rather than legal documents. It's a simple, straightforward approach that's worked well for us over the years."

        "value": "I'll tell you exactly what makes us different - we do what we say we're going to do, period. I encourage anyone interested in selling to us to check with every single person we've bought a business from. In fact, I especially encourage them to talk with those whose businesses faced tough times, because that's when you really learn about a buyer's character. Many buyers will promise the moon during negotiations, particularly about how much they need you to stay involved. And while they might genuinely mean it at the time, their actions often don't match those early promises once the deal is done. At Berkshire, we behave exactly as promised for two reasons. First, because we gave our word, and second, because we've learned it's essential for achieving the best business results. That's why we pay in cash, keep our promises simple, and follow through on every commitment. We don't need elaborate contracts or complex deals - we operate on mutual trust and straightforward agreements. This approach has served us well, and it's why so many family businesses choose to join Berkshire when they could sell to others for more money. They know exactly what they're getting with us, and they know we'll deliver on every promise we make."

We don't use the business as collateral, and we don't involve any brokers. What I think is particularly important is that when we make a deal, it sticks. You won't see us coming back later with excuses about banks or boards of directors changing terms. I've always believed in dealing directly with owners. When you work with Berkshire, you're dealing with me, and that won't change. You won't have one executive negotiate the deal only to have someone else in charge later. We don't play those corporate games where suddenly the board requires changes or wants to sell your business to finance some new project. It's clean, it's simple, and it's permanent. That's how we've always done business at Berkshire, and that's how we'll continue to do it."

        "value": "I believe in being completely honest with sellers about what they're getting into. The reality is, if you own 100% of a valuable business, selling it doesn't make you wealthier - it just changes the form of your wealth. Let me be very clear about this: when you sell to us, you're essentially trading something you know very well - your own business - for cash that will probably end up being invested in small pieces of other businesses that you understand less well. Now, there can be perfectly good reasons to sell a business, but getting richer isn't one of them if the transaction is fair. What you're really doing is exchanging one type of valuable asset for another. I think it's important that sellers understand this fundamental truth. That's why when we acquire businesses, we're not promising to make anyone richer - we're offering a fair exchange of value and a good home for businesses where owners can continue to run their operations with pride and satisfaction, just as they've always done."
