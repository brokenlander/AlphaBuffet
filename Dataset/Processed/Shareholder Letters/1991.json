Let me explain it this way: When we were managing $20 million in capital, finding an opportunity that produced $1 million in profit would add five percentage points to our return for the year. That was doable - there are quite a few ways to make $1 million. But now, with our current size, we need to find ideas or businesses producing $370 million in profit to move the needle by that same five percentage points. And I can tell you, there are far fewer ways to make $370 million than $1 million. It's like trying to steer a large ship versus a small boat - the bigger you get, the fewer harbors you can enter. The universe of opportunities that can meaningfully impact Berkshire's performance keeps shrinking as our equity capital grows. That's why Charlie and I have adjusted our expectations and now aim for a 15% average annual increase in intrinsic value, which still means we need to earn $22 billion over the next decade. That's no small task."

        "value": "The outsized gain we saw in 1991 was primarily due to something that doesn't happen often - a dramatic rise in the price-earnings ratios of just two stocks: Coca-Cola and Gillette. These two investments alone accounted for nearly $1.6 billion of our $2.1 billion growth in net worth that year. To put that in perspective, when we made our big investment in Coke three years earlier, Berkshire's entire net worth was $3.4 billion. Now, our Coke investment alone is worth more than that. But I want to be very clear with shareholders - this kind of dramatic appreciation in price-earnings ratios isn't something we can count on happening regularly. It's not our typical way of creating value. We're really looking for great businesses at fair prices that can compound value over time through their operations, not through multiple expansion. That's why I specifically noted this was 'a phenomenon not apt to be repeated.'"

You see, we have extraordinary operators like the Blumkins, the Friedman family, Mike Goldberg, and others who are absolute masters of their businesses. They don't need me hovering over them or telling them how to run their operations. I'm reminded of that story about George Mira's coach at the University of Miami. When Mira threw that miraculous left-handed touchdown pass while being tackled, his coach just turned and said, 'Now that's what I call coaching.' The truth is, the coach had nothing to do with it - just like Charlie and I have very little to do with the day-to-day success of our operating units. The real work is done by our managers. That's why I could take on other responsibilities, like the interim role at Salomon, without Berkshire skipping a beat. Our managers are so outstanding that they don't need my constant attention. This approach has worked wonderfully for us at Berkshire, and it's a fundamental part of our success."

While I knew I could reduce my time at Berkshire without affecting its economic progress, that doesn't mean my commitment has wavered one bit. In fact, when a student at Harvard Business School asked me about retirement, I told them I planned to retire 'about five to ten years after I die.' That's not just a quip - it reflects my deep, permanent commitment to Berkshire. The company's structure allows me to take on other responsibilities because we have such outstanding operating managers. But make no mistake - Berkshire always comes first. Our managers are so capable that the company's performance isn't affected if Charlie or I need to step away briefly. But Berkshire is and always will be my primary focus. It's not just a job or an investment - it's my life's work, and I intend to keep it that way for as long as I'm around, and then some."

What you want is to build that company to deliver the highest possible look-through earnings over the long term - I'm talking about a decade or more from now. This approach naturally shifts your attention away from short-term market movements and toward the fundamental business prospects of your holdings. While it's true that market prices ultimately determine investment success, those prices will eventually be driven by the earnings these businesses generate.

Looking at the numbers I've shared, you can see we take our major investments - companies like Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Wells Fargo - and calculate our portion of their earnings based on our ownership percentage. We then subtract a hypothetical tax provision on these undistributed earnings. Finally, we add this figure to Berkshire's own reported operating earnings to get our total look-through earnings. This gives us a much more complete picture of Berkshire's economic performance than just looking at our reported earnings alone. It shows the true earning power of our entire enterprise, including both our wholly-owned businesses and our share of the earnings power in our investment portfolio. This method reflects my belief that what matters isn't just what shows up in our reported earnings, but the total earnings being generated by all the businesses we have an interest in."

I've always said that a franchise has three key characteristics: First, it provides something that people need or desire. Second, and this is crucial, customers believe there's no real substitute for it. And third, it's not subject to price regulation. When you have all three of these elements working together, you'll see it in the numbers - the business can price aggressively and earn high returns on capital. Now, what's happened with media companies is particularly interesting. They used to be wonderful franchises, but we're seeing a fundamental shift. The economics have changed as retailing patterns evolved and we've seen this explosion in advertising and entertainment choices. You know, it's funny - looking in the rear-view mirror, as I like to say, everything's crystal clear. But a few years ago, nobody in the media business - not the lenders, not the owners, not even the analysts - saw this coming. They're now behaving more like regular businesses than franchises. And that's a big change in their economic character."

When I say that in investing, just as in baseball, you need to watch the playing field and not the scoreboard, I'm talking about focusing on what really matters - future earnings. You see, prices will be determined by future earnings, not past performance. It's very similar to baseball in that way. If you're just staring at the scoreboard, you're looking at what's already happened, not what's about to happen on the field. And in investing, just like in baseball, it's what's about to happen that counts. This is particularly relevant when we look at how many investors and analysts missed the changing dynamics in the media industry. They were watching the scoreboard - the historical performance and metrics - while the actual game on the field was changing dramatically with new competition and shifting consumer behaviors. That's why I always emphasize looking at the fundamental factors that will drive future performance rather than getting too caught up in past results."

A true economic franchise needs three key ingredients: First, it must offer something people really need or want. Second, customers must believe there's no real substitute for it. And third - and this is important - it can't be subject to price regulation. When you have all three, you'll see it in the numbers - these businesses can price aggressively and earn high returns on capital. Here's what's fascinating about franchises: they're incredibly durable. Even poor management can't destroy them. Sure, bad managers might reduce profitability, but they won't kill the franchise. Now, contrast that with a regular business. A regular business can only earn exceptional profits in two ways: either by being the low-cost operator or by operating in a market where supply is tight. And let me tell you, tight supply usually doesn't last long. Even with great management, a regular business is always looking over its shoulder for competitive threats. And unlike a franchise, poor management can absolutely kill a regular business. That's why I've always been particularly interested in franchise businesses - they have a built-in margin of safety that regular businesses just don't have."

This meant they could price aggressively and even survive mediocre management. But things have changed dramatically. The big shift we're seeing is on the supply side. Consumers now have vastly more choices for both information and entertainment - and let's be honest, it's mostly entertainment they're after. But here's the key constraint that makes this situation so interesting: we still only have 500 million American eyeballs and 24 hours in a day. That's a fixed limit on demand that can't expand to match the explosive growth in supply. It's simple mathematics really. When you have more suppliers competing for a fixed amount of attention, something has to give. What's given is the franchise power of traditional media. The market has fragmented, competition has become more intense, and while media hasn't completely lost its franchise characteristics, it's certainly not what it used to be. And this weakening of the franchise has implications that go well beyond just current earnings - it fundamentally affects the long-term value of these businesses."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, let me walk you through this because it's quite important to understand. In the past, we had this conventional wisdom that media properties were essentially perpetual growth machines - growing at 6% annually without requiring additional capital. Under that rosy scenario, if you had a property earning $1 million after-tax and used a 10% discount rate, you could justify paying $25 million for it. That's a multiple of 25 times after-tax earnings, or about 16 times pre-tax. But here's the key thing - that valuation was built on an assumption that isn't holding up anymore. When you change the assumption to what I call a 'bob-around' pattern - where earnings just fluctuate around that $1 million rather than growing steadily - the same property is only worth $10 million using the same discount rate. That's a dramatic difference in value, and it shows why we need to be very careful about our assumptions when valuing businesses. The math may seem oversimplified, but it illustrates a crucial principle: the value of any business depends enormously on whether you can count on that growth, and many media properties simply can't deliver that steady growth anymore."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The traditional view of media properties was quite interesting, and I'll tell you exactly why people thought this way. The thinking was that these businesses had a beautiful characteristic: their depreciation charges would roughly match their capital expenditure needs, and they required very little in terms of working capital. In other words, the reported earnings - before we counted amortization of intangibles - were essentially the same as freely-distributable earnings. This made these properties look like perfect perpetual annuities. You didn't need to plow money back into the business to maintain its competitive position or fuel growth. Every dollar of earnings could theoretically be paid out to owners. That's why these properties commanded such premium valuations in the past. But as we've seen with the weakening franchise value in the industry, those assumptions about capital requirements and automatic growth don't necessarily hold true anymore. It's a good reminder that we always need to question our assumptions about any business model, no matter how solid it may have appeared in the past."

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, a bob-around pattern is what you see in most businesses where their income stream can only grow if owners keep putting more capital in, typically through retained earnings. Let me give you a concrete example from the text - think about steel mills versus traditional media companies. Historically, steel companies were classic bob-around businesses. Their earnings would bounce around a certain level unless you kept feeding them capital. Now, this pattern has a direct impact on valuation. When you have a bob-around business, you might value it at around 10 times after-tax earnings, or about 6 1/2 times pre-tax earnings. That's because you don't expect natural growth without additional capital investment. It's important to understand that dollars are dollars - whether they come from media properties or steel mills. The only reason media companies historically commanded higher valuations was that their earnings were expected to grow constantly without requiring much additional capital. But when a business shifts from being viewed as a growth business to a bob-around business, as we're seeing with media now, the valuation multiples must change dramatically."

This is true even when we face secular transformations in an industry, as we're experiencing with our media investments. Take our holdings in Buffalo News, The Washington Post Company, and Capital Cities/ABC. Yes, their intrinsic value has declined materially because of secular changes in the media industry. And I want to make an important distinction here - we're not talking about cyclical factors, which can temporarily affect our look-through earnings but don't reduce intrinsic value. We're talking about fundamental, secular transformations. But here's the key point: even when we see this happening, even when we recognize that intrinsic value has declined, we maintain our positions if they're in our permanent category. This isn't just sentiment - it's one of our core Business Principles.

In 1972, we were still focused primarily on tangible net worth - which was only $7 million for See's - and that led us to initially balk at anything above $25 million for the purchase. The sellers wanted $40 million, but with $10 million in excess cash, the true price was $30 million. What we came to understand through See's performance was the incredible value of a strong franchise. Look at the numbers: See's went from $29 million in sales and $4.2 million in pre-tax profits in 1972 to $196 million in sales and $42.4 million in pre-tax profits by 1991. That kind of growth with minimal capital investment is exactly what makes a wonderful business. We were lucky the sellers accepted our $25 million offer, because our focus on tangible assets almost caused us to miss out on what became an excellent investment. The key is understanding that the true value of a business often lies in its intangible franchise value rather than just its physical assets."

First, most media properties still possess better economic characteristics than the average American business - that's important to understand.

That's just $25 million total capital needed to operate comfortably. Meanwhile, the business generated $410 million in pre-tax profits that we could deploy elsewhere in Blue Chip and Berkshire. The profits grew from $4.2 million pre-tax in 1972 to $42.4 million, far outpacing sales growth. This is exactly what we look for - a business that can grow profits substantially without requiring much additional capital investment. The key metric isn't just profit growth in isolation - you have to compare it to the incremental capital required to produce those profits. On this score, See's has been nothing short of astounding.

We were fortunate that the deal didn't fall apart due to our stubborn insistence on a $25 million price, which honestly was a bit dumb in retrospect. But the real home run was finding Chuck Huggins, who was See's executive vice-president at the time. We put him in charge immediately, and both our business and personal experiences with him have been outstanding. Here's a telling example - we worked out his compensation arrangement in about five minutes, just sealed it with a handshake, never even wrote up a contract, and that same arrangement remains unchanged today. That speaks volumes about the quality of the management and the relationship. Even in challenging times, like 1991 when pound volume was down 4% and sales were flat, the business still grew profits by 7% and achieved a record 21.6% pre-tax margin.

Their key managers receive a modest base salary - just $7,800 annually - but then earn a percentage of profits after accounting for capital costs. This is crucial because most compensation systems out there are heavy on rewards but light on real risk, and they typically ignore the cost of equity capital entirely. It's like they're playing with house money. But at Brown, these managers are truly standing in the shoes of owners. They feel the impact of capital costs just like shareholders do. And you know what? It works wonderfully for both sides. I've always found that when managers are willing to bet heavily on their own performance like this, it's usually because they've got the goods to back it up. It's a far cry from the typical corporate arrangement where executives talk about alignment but create compensation systems that protect them from downside risk while giving them all the upside."

We don't want to come in and change what's already working well. Now, I always tell potential sellers to do their homework on us - talk to the folks we've done business with before. That's the best way to understand how we operate. What we're not looking for are turnarounds, new ventures, or auction-style sales. As I like to say, borrowing from that country song: 'When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's me.' We get plenty of calls from people trying to sell us something different from what we're looking for - it's like advertising for collies and getting calls about cocker spaniels."

When insurance companies find their business isn't performing well, some try to hide the problems through accounting techniques, particularly by under-reserving for losses. We saw this potentially happening last year - while premium growth wasn't keeping pace with the needed 10% rate, the combined ratio actually showed a slight improvement instead of the deterioration I expected. Now, when you look at the loss-reserve data for the industry, there's good reason to be skeptical of those reported results. The fundamental problem is that these accounting maneuvers don't fix the underlying business issues - they just postpone the day of reckoning. It's like that patient with the doctored x-rays - the illness isn't going away just because you've hidden it. In the long run, this approach always catches up with management, and the eventual consequences are usually worse than if they'd faced the problems head-on."

Float is the total of loss reserves, loss adjustment expense reserves and unearned premium reserves, minus agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance. What makes float so important for us is that we generate it in exceptional amounts, and its true cost is measured by our underwriting loss. You see, while many in the industry focus on combined ratios, we've evolved our insurance business in ways that make those ratios largely irrelevant to our performance. What really counts for us is what we call the 'cost of funds developed from insurance' - or in simpler terms, the cost of float. This is fundamentally different from traditional insurance metrics, and it's why we look at our insurance operations through a different lens than many others in the industry. We've structured our operations to maximize this float while keeping its cost reasonable, which has become a key driver of our overall performance."

We're probably the largest writer of this type of insurance in the world. Let me give you the arithmetic: With roughly $100 million in annual super-cat premiums, we could see anything from a $100 million profit in a year without major catastrophes to a $200 million loss if we get hit with a couple of big hurricanes or earthquakes. We price this business expecting to pay out about 90% of premiums over the long term. The challenge is that GAAP accounting doesn't let us set up reserves during good years for the losses we know will come in bad years. It's like having a one-year yardstick to measure a five-year phenomenon - it just doesn't fit quite right. That's why in any given year, we'll look either enormously profitable or enormously unprofitable. This is something shareholders need to understand when looking at our annual results."

You see, just having float isn't enough - it's like having a large bank account where you might have to pay high interest. The real victory is in both growing the float and keeping the cost of those funds satisfactory. Looking ahead, we expect our float to continue growing - that's not really the challenge. The real challenge, and what we focus on, is making sure we can continue to garner these funds at a reasonable cost. It's like running a business where you can borrow more and more money, but you need to make sure the interest rate doesn't eat up all your profits. That's what we're always watching carefully."

Look, when I was personally running our insurance operation, Berkshire was what I call an 'innocent' - meaning we didn't truly understand the risks we were taking on. In the 1980s, there were lots of these innocents providing reinsurance protection for catastrophic events. But here's what happens: these insurers get financially burned beyond recognition when major catastrophes hit. It's a painful lesson. But the fascinating thing about both insurance and investing is that people tend to have short memories. After a few quiet years without major catastrophes, new innocents will inevitably show up in the market. When that happens, prices for super-cat policies will drop to silly levels. It's as predictable as the sunrise. That's why we take a different approach - we stay disciplined and only write these policies when the rates make sense. And thanks to our financial strength, we can be a major player when the pricing is right. But we're not afraid to step back when others are being foolish with their pricing."

That's actually bigger than Hurricane Hugo, which was the previous record-holder. But here's the key point - that event only triggered payments from about 25% of our policies, resulting in an underwriting profit of about $11 million for the year. This perfectly illustrates why looking at our catastrophe business through a one-year lens can be misleading. The nature of super-cat insurance is inherently lumpy and irregular. You might go several years with excellent results and then have one event that changes everything. That's why I want our shareholders to understand this reality when they're assessing our annual results. You can't judge this business on a calendar-year basis - it just doesn't match the fundamental nature of catastrophe risk. The key is to maintain a long-term perspective and understand that any single year's results, good or bad, don't tell the whole story."

I'm reminded of what Jackie Mason says: 'I'm fixed for life - as long as I don't buy anything.' That's the position some reinsurers might find themselves in. But at Berkshire, we have the financial capacity to handle major catastrophes, and that's why we'll continue to be a major participant in this market as long as the rates remain adequate. Mike Goldberg has done a remarkable job managing this operation, and while we can't put a precise number on its value, it's become one of our most valuable assets."

You see, I've always believed that the stock market is essentially a relocation center where money moves from the active to the patient. Recent events have actually proven this point quite well. Look at what I call the 'idle rich' - they've maintained or increased their wealth by staying put. Meanwhile, many of the 'energetic rich' - those aggressive real estate operators, corporate acquirers, and oil drillers - have watched their fortunes disappear. It's a fascinating validation of our approach. When we find great businesses, we prefer to hold them rather than constantly trading in and out of positions.

As I like to say, 'If at first you do succeed, quit trying.' I find myself in complete agreement with Keynes on this. He wrote something very insightful in 1934 that captures this perfectly - that the right investment method is to put fairly large sums into enterprises you understand and whose management you completely trust. The common notion that spreading your money across many businesses you know little about reduces risk is, in my view, completely backwards. Your knowledge and experience are naturally limited. In my experience, there are rarely more than two or three enterprises at any given time where you can have full confidence.

What makes it especially difficult is this vicious cycle we see with bankruptcies. When airlines go bankrupt, the courts let them keep operating, and here's the problem: these bankrupt carriers can set fares below the industry's actual costs because they're not paying the same capital costs as solvent airlines. They're essentially burning the furniture to provide firewood - selling off assets to fund losses and stay alive. This creates a domino effect that's perfectly designed to bring the whole industry to its knees. One carrier goes down, undercuts prices, and then takes others with it.
