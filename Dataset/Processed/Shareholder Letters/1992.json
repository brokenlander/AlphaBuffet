Now, that's made things challenging over the years because we've always valued our shares highly. But you see, we're only interested in increasing Berkshire's size when it increases our owners' wealth. Those two things - getting bigger and creating value - don't always go together. Let me share a story that illustrates this perfectly. We once had an investment in a bank that was absolutely determined to expand - you know how bankers can get. When they tried to acquire a smaller bank, the seller demanded a stock swap that valued their operation at more than double our bank's metrics. And our management, well, they were so eager they just gave in. The seller was smart enough to know it was a bad deal - he even made them promise never to do something that foolish again after he became a major shareholder. That's exactly the kind of expansion we avoid at Berkshire. We're not interested in getting bigger just for the sake of size."

But here's the thing - achieving this goal in a smooth, steady way is simply impossible. Let me explain why. A major factor is our insurance companies' stock portfolios, which represent a significant portion of Berkshire's net worth. Since 1979, accounting rules require us to value these securities at market prices, after adjusting for taxes on unrealized gains. This GAAP requirement means our reported results will naturally bounce around with market prices, even if our underlying businesses are performing steadily. It's just the nature of the beast when you own a large portfolio of publicly traded securities. So while we maintain our focus on that 15% goal, we have to accept that the path there will have some bumps and variations along the way."

Since 1979, these rules have required us to value these securities at their market prices, after adjusting for taxes on unrealized gains. You see, when you're holding a large portfolio of stocks like we do, regular market fluctuations can cause our reported results to bounce around quite a bit. It's quite different from a typical industrial company that's mainly reporting operating earnings. Think of it this way - we essentially have two components to our results. There's our operating businesses, which tend to be fairly steady, and then there's our investment portfolio, which can swing significantly with market prices. The GAAP rules mean we have to reflect those market swings in our reported numbers, even if we haven't sold a single share. That's why you'll see our annual results gyrate more than companies that don't hold such large investment portfolios. It's important to understand this isn't necessarily reflecting any fundamental change in our businesses - it's largely an accounting effect."

In our early days, we had a significant investment in our textile operation, and I have to be frank - it was a real drag on our performance. The returns we got from textiles were far below what we could have earned if we'd simply put that money into the S&P 500. But over time, we've made a fundamental shift in our approach. We've built up what I'd call a collection of exceptional businesses, run by equally exceptional managers. These operating businesses now generate returns that are typically well above what you'd get from the S&P 500. This transformation has had a major impact on both our absolute performance and how we compare to the broader market. The key here is that we've moved from businesses that were capital-intensive with low returns, like textiles, to owning high-quality operations that generate strong, consistent earnings. This shift means that a much larger portion of our earnings now comes from operating businesses rather than just investment returns, and these businesses are largely unaffected by stock market valuations."

You see, both our income and capital gains from securities get hit with substantial corporate taxes, while the S&P returns you see quoted are pre-tax numbers. Let me give you a concrete example: Under our current tax system, if the S&P gains 18%, a corporation holding that index - like Berkshire - actually gets a return well below 13% after taxes. That's a big haircut. If we had owned nothing but the S&P index during the 28-year period I discussed, our after-tax corporate performance would have been notably lower than the pre-tax S&P returns shown in those tables. And this disadvantage could become even more severe if corporate tax rates increase in the future. It's simply a structural reality we have to accept - there's no way around it. It's like running a race where you're forced to carry a heavy backpack while others run unencumbered. The weight is always there, and we just have to factor that into our performance expectations."

But then we shifted gears and built our collection of exceptional businesses run by equally exceptional managers, which has given us returns well above the S&P in more recent years. However, Charlie and I are looking at two important factors going forward. First, we're virtually certain that S&P returns over the next decade will be significantly lower than what we've seen in the past decade. Second - and this is absolutely certain - our expanding capital base will substantially reduce our historical advantage relative to the index. It's simply a matter of size - when you're working with the kind of capital we have now, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the same percentage returns we achieved when we were smaller.

It's an anchor we have to drag along, and there's no way around it. It's a structural disadvantage we simply have to live with, and there's no antidote for it. The real question isn't whether this will impact our relative performance - it absolutely will - but rather whether we can drag that anchor along at some tolerable, though slowed, pace. We'll still aim to do well, but shareholders need to understand that our historical advantage relative to the index will be substantially reduced. That's not pessimism, that's just reality. And when you combine this with our concentrated portfolio and our commitment to areas like super-catastrophe insurance, we're going to see considerable volatility in our annual results. That's just part of the package when you're dealing with the scale we're at now."

We've long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good. However, we're making a rare longer-term prediction here: we are virtually certain that the return over the next decade from an investment in the S&P index will be far less than that of the past decade. This isn't because we've suddenly become market timers - we haven't. It's simply because it's clear that stocks cannot forever overperform their underlying businesses, as they have so dramatically done for some time. This is basic mathematics and business reality. When stock performance gets too far ahead of business performance, as it has, there must be a period of adjustment. That's why we're quite confident in forecasting that the rewards from investing in stocks over the next decade will be significantly smaller than they were in the last."

Think about it like baseball - we're focused on slugging percentage, not batting average. Now, there are several reasons why we experience considerable volatility in our annual results. First, there's the general volatility of the stock market itself. Then, we concentrate our equity holdings in just a few companies rather than diversifying broadly. And we've made some specific business decisions, like our major commitment to super-catastrophe insurance, that can create significant swings in our results. But here's the key point - if you're going to achieve superior long-term returns, you need to be willing to accept some short-term turbulence. It's just like a good power hitter in baseball who knows that swinging for the fences means you'll have more strikeouts, but you'll also hit more home runs. That's the approach we take at Berkshire."

However, I certainly missed Berkshire, and I was delighted to return full-time. There's no job in the world that is more fun than running Berkshire, and I count myself lucky to be where I am. Now, regarding Salomon, we did achieve some significant things. The firm ranked second among 311 companies in Fortune's survey of Most Admired Corporations in terms of reputation improvement. Salomon Brothers also reported record pre-tax earnings - 34% above their previous high. But what really stands out to me is how critical good leadership is in a crisis. Without the combined efforts of key executives like Deryck Maughan, Bob Denham, Don Howard, and John Macfarlane, the firm probably wouldn't have survived. That's not an exaggeration.

These individuals demonstrated exactly what you want to see in a crisis: tireless dedication, effectiveness, and most importantly, selflessness. But beyond the executive team, we also needed exceptional legal expertise. Ron Olson from Munger, Tolles & Olson was instrumental because we were dealing with an incredibly complex situation involving multiple government authorities - the SEC, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Attorney's office, and the Department of Justice. When you're facing that kind of regulatory gauntlet, you need someone with not just legal knowledge, but also business acumen and people skills. Ron had that rare combination. I've always believed that in business, like in life, having the right people in place is critical. In Salomon's case, without this specific group of individuals working together, I can tell you quite frankly that the firm probably wouldn't have made it."

Now, this might sound simple, but here's where we differ from many other managers - we're willing to wait for the right opportunity. I like to compare it to looking for a spouse: you should be active, interested, and open-minded, but you absolutely shouldn't be in a hurry. What I've noticed is that many acquisition-hungry managers seem to take the opposite approach. They're like those children's stories about kissing frogs to find a prince or princess - they think if they just keep making acquisitions, eventually they'll find that magical transformation. That's not how it works in business. Good acquisitions aren't easy to make, but that doesn't mean you should lower your standards.

They're so eager to make deals that they'll pay premium prices to kiss corporate toads, convinced they can transform them into princes. When it doesn't work out, instead of learning their lesson, they just look for more toads to kiss. I learned this lesson myself early on - I dated some toads too. They were cheap dates, mind you, but the results weren't any better than those who paid up for expensive toads. The key insight came to me through some golf advice I once received: 'Practice doesn't make perfect; practice makes permanent.' That's when I changed my strategy completely. Instead of chasing fair businesses at good prices, I started focusing on finding good businesses at fair prices. It's a fundamental shift in thinking that has served us much better over the years."

I've seen this pattern play out countless times. Managers get caught up in deal-making for its own sake, and when their corporate toads don't turn into princes, they don't step back and reassess. Instead, they double down and look for more toads to kiss. Eventually, reality catches up, and that's when you see these massive 'restructuring' charges announced. It's like a corporate Head Start program where the CEO gets the education, but the stockholders end up paying the tuition. This is exactly why we've moved away from that approach at Berkshire. You know, it reminds me of my early days when I made similar mistakes - though I was always too frugal to pay much for my toads. The key is to recognize that volume of acquisitions isn't the goal - quality is. That's why we now focus on finding genuinely good businesses rather than trying to get bargain prices on mediocre ones."

Finally, you subtract the taxes we'd have to pay if those retained earnings had been distributed to us. Now, while no single number can tell you everything about a business, I believe look-through earnings give you a much better picture of Berkshire's true earning power than GAAP figures alone. Think of it this way - when we own a significant portion of a business, their retained earnings are working for us whether they're distributed or not. It's like having a farmer working your field - the crops are growing whether you've harvested them or not. The value is being created either way.

But here's the key point - this long-term target guides our decision-making today. When we allocate capital, we're thinking about what will maximize look-through earnings years from now. However - and this is important - focusing on the long term doesn't give us a free pass on short-term results. I like to use a farming analogy here: If you planted crops five or ten years ago thinking about long-term returns, those plantings should be bearing fruit now. If you keep planting confidently but your harvests consistently disappoint, there's something wrong with your farming methods. The same applies to business - good long-term thinking should still produce reasonable results along the way."

We make long-range decisions all the time at Berkshire - decisions we made 5 or 10 years ago should be bearing fruit now. If management keeps promising 'jam tomorrow' as the Queen told Alice, but never delivers 'jam today,' that's a red flag. It's similar to how we view managers who manipulate short-term earnings through accounting tricks or asset sales - it's a sign something isn't right. The reality is that for some companies, and even entire industries, there simply isn't a good long-term strategy available.

For instance, when we own 18.2% of Capital Cities/ABC, we include 18.2% of their retained earnings in our look-through calculations. Now, I should mention these figures are necessarily rough approximations. The dividends we receive from these companies are already included in our operating earnings under 'Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.' But the look-through concept gives us a more complete picture of how our investments are really performing. We track this carefully for all our major investees - companies like Coca-Cola, GEICO, Gillette, and others - because it helps us understand the full economic reality of our ownership stakes, beyond just the dividends we receive."

It added about four points to the industry's combined ratio that year, making it the largest insured loss in history at the time. But here's the really important lesson - it exposed which companies had inadequate reinsurance protection. You see, I always say it's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked. That's exactly what happened here. Some smaller insurers were completely destroyed, and one major insurer only survived because it had a wealthy parent company that could quickly inject capital. The really sobering thing is that Andrew could have been even more devastating if it had hit just 20 or 30 miles further north in Florida or struck Louisiana differently. This event forced many companies to completely rethink their reinsurance strategies, and rightfully so."

Now, regarding Andrew, we certainly took our share of hits. The losses we suffered were about $125 million, which was roughly equal to our entire super-cat premium income for 1992. But here's something important to understand about the insurance business - even with a combined ratio above 100, you can still break even or make money when you factor in the investment income from the float. That's the money we get to hold and invest between collecting premiums and paying claims. In fact, a combined ratio in the 106-110 range typically produces a break-even result when you consider the investment income from float, not counting shareholders' equity. So while Andrew was certainly a significant event for us, it's exactly the kind of risk we're in business to handle, and we had the financial strength to absorb it."

We have to consider multiple factors that are constantly changing. Take global warming for instance - even tiny changes in atmospheric conditions can create huge shifts in weather patterns. Then there's the population growth in coastal areas. A hurricane that caused x dollars in damage 20 years ago might cost 10x today simply because there's more development and higher property values in vulnerable areas. This is why having someone like Ajit Jain running our reinsurance operation is so crucial. He's simply the best in this business at separating the good proposals from the bad ones.

But it happened in 1886, measuring about 6.6 on the Richter scale and causing 60 deaths. Even more surprising, our country's most serious earthquake occurred in New Madrid, Missouri, of all places - an 8.7 magnitude event in 1812. To put that in perspective, the 1989 San Francisco earthquake was a 7.1, and remember that each one-point increase on the Richter scale represents a ten-fold increase in strength. So the New Madrid quake was orders of magnitude more powerful than what hit San Francisco. These historical events remind us that catastrophic risks can appear in unexpected places, and we need to be humble about our ability to predict where the next big event might occur. That's partly why we're so selective in the reinsurance business - we know that assuming we can perfectly predict these events would be foolish."

Unless there's a compelling reason to sell - like a fundamental change in the business or a much better opportunity elsewhere - we prefer to just keep owning great businesses."

Initially, we looked at General Dynamics purely as an arbitrage play when they announced their Dutch tender to repurchase about 30% of their shares. We'd done similar arbitrage deals maybe a half-dozen times in previous years, usually making decent returns for short holding periods. But here's where it gets interesting - and this is crucial for investors to understand: When I started really studying the company and CEO Bill Anders' work, my whole perspective changed. I saw something that made my eyes pop: a CEO with a clear, rational strategy who was executing it with focus and urgency, producing remarkable results. This led us to completely abandon our arbitrage approach in favor of becoming long-term investors. The tender actually helped us build our position because it increased trading volume, letting us acquire 14% of the remaining shares. This fits perfectly with our long-standing approach to equity investing - we evaluate stocks just as we would evaluate a business for complete acquisition. Sometimes your initial investment thesis can be completely transformed by thorough analysis, and you need to be willing to change your mind when the facts warrant it."

I'll admit that I myself engaged in this kind of thinking some years ago, but I've learned better. Look, these two approaches are actually joined at the hip - they're not in opposition at all. Growth is always a component when we calculate value. Sometimes its importance might be negligible, sometimes it might be enormous, and interestingly, its impact can be negative just as easily as positive. The key thing to understand is that you can't separate them the way many investment professionals try to do. Those analysts who feel they must choose between 'value' and 'growth' are creating a false dichotomy. In fact, I'd go further and say that the term 'value investing' itself is redundant. Think about it - what is investing if it's not the act of seeking value at least sufficient to justify the amount paid? If you're consciously paying more for a stock than its calculated value, hoping to sell it to someone else at an even higher price, well, that's not investing - that's speculation. And while speculation isn't illegal or immoral, in our view, it's not financially fattening either."

Second, it needs to have favorable long-term prospects. We're not interested in businesses that look good for just a quarter or two. Third, it must be operated by honest and competent people. The best business model in the world won't help you if you've got the wrong people running it. And fourth, it needs to be available at an attractive price. Now, I should mention that we've made one small but significant change to this criteria over the years. In our 1977 annual report, we said we wanted a 'very attractive price.' But because of both market conditions and our size, we've had to modify that to just 'an attractive price.' That's the only change we've made to these criteria in fifteen years, which should tell you something about how fundamental we believe these principles are."

Now, many folks talk about 'value investing' and point to metrics like low P/E ratios, high dividend yields, or low price-to-book values. But here's the important thing: these characteristics, even when they show up together, don't automatically mean you're getting value for your money. And the opposite is equally true - you can find genuine value in stocks with high P/E ratios or low dividend yields. The key isn't in these surface-level metrics. What matters is whether you're buying something for what it's worth. I've always believed that true investing means understanding the underlying value of what you're buying, regardless of how it might be categorized by traditional metrics. It's about substance over labels, and that's something many market participants seem to forget."

Let me give you a perfect example that I often point to: the airline industry. Investors have consistently poured money into airlines to finance growth, and what have they got to show for it? I sometimes joke that it would have been better for investors if Orville Wright had never gotten off the ground at Kitty Hawk. You see, the more that industry has grown, the worse it's been for owners. Here's what really matters: growth only benefits investors when a business can invest at incremental returns that are enticing - in other words, when each dollar used to finance the growth creates more than a dollar of long-term market value. That's the critical test. Without that, growth can actually destroy value rather than create it. It's not about how much you're growing; it's about what that growth is worth."

You see, growth only benefits investors when a business can invest at incremental returns that are truly enticing - in other words, when each dollar used to finance the growth creates more than a dollar of long-term market value. This is absolutely crucial to understand. In the case of a low-return business that keeps requiring more capital, growth actually hurts the investor. It's like pouring good money after bad. The airline industry has been precisely this type of growth trap - massive expansion but poor returns for owners. So when I look at a business, I'm not impressed by growth for growth's sake. I want to see growth that creates real value for shareholders, where the incremental returns justify the capital being invested. Otherwise, you're better off avoiding that growth altogether."

The fundamental equation for value is actually the same for both stocks and bonds - it's determined by cash inflows and outflows, discounted at an appropriate interest rate, over the remaining life of the asset. But here's where it gets interesting - and this is crucial for investors to understand. With bonds, you've got a defined coupon and maturity date that tells you exactly what those future cash flows will be. It's all laid out for you. With stocks, though, you've got to do the heavy lifting yourself as an analyst to estimate those future 'coupons.' And there's another big difference: management quality. With bonds, management really only comes into play in extreme cases - like when they're so incompetent or dishonest that they suspend interest payments. But with stocks, management's abilities can dramatically affect those equity 'coupons.' That's why when we're looking at stocks, we have to be much more careful about assessing the quality of management and their ability to generate those future cash flows. The principle I follow is simple - buy the investment that the discounted cash flow calculation shows to be cheapest, regardless of whether it's growing fast or slow, volatile or stable, or priced high or low relative to current earnings and book value."

Now, historically, our calculations have usually shown equities to be more attractive than bonds, but that's not set in stone. There have been times when bonds were the better buy, and when that happens, that's where we put our money. You see, too many investors get caught up in labels or conventional wisdom about what they 'should' buy. They look at price-to-earnings ratios or book values in isolation. But what really matters is the relationship between price and value, as determined by future cash flows. At Berkshire, we try to be absolutely rational about this. We'll buy whatever offers the best value proposition, whether that's stocks, bonds, or, as some folks remember, even silver at one point.

First, the very best business you can own - and these are rare - is one that can deploy large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return over a long period.

That's why when we find businesses that can't reinvest effectively, we prefer they return capital to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. Now, on evaluating complex businesses - we simply don't do it. At Berkshire, we stick to what we understand. If a business is too complex or constantly changing, we take a pass. Why? Because even experienced analysts can make serious mistakes in estimating future cash flows. And if we can't predict the cash flows with reasonable certainty, we can't value the business. That's why we prefer simple, stable businesses that we can understand. Some people think this approach is too limiting, but I've always believed that knowing your limitations is just as important as knowing your abilities.

What makes this interesting for investors like us is that you'll regularly find situations where a business worth x is selling for 1/2x or even less. That's because there's always someone who needs to sell, regardless of the price. It's like a continuous auction where prices can swing wildly from true value. This creates opportunities that you just don't find in new issues, where the pricing is much more controlled and usually tilted in favor of the seller. We've seen this play out in our own results - our performance with secondary market purchases has consistently beaten what we've achieved with negotiated purchases of new preferreds, even though we've had some wins like our Gillette preferred conversion.

That's a whole different ballgame. There, you're dealing with controlling stockholders and corporations who can pick and choose when they want to sell. They're not forced to sell at any particular time - if they don't like the market price, they can simply wait. And believe me, they're not in the business of offering bargains. In fact, they typically only want to sell when they think the market is overpaying. Though they'd never put it quite that way - they'd say they're just 'resistant to selling when the market is underpaying.'

The company was caught between a rock and a hard place.

Yet, and here's the puzzling part, many of these same managers had no problem committing their own companies to essentially identical obligations through self-insurance plans.

The irony is that many of these same executives would criticize Congress for using similar cash-basis thinking with Social Security promises.

It's all just a way to avoid facing up to reality in financial reporting."

Let me walk you through their typical excuses. First, they claim options are just too difficult to value - but that's really a smoke screen. Then they try to pull at heartstrings by saying proper option accounting would harm small start-up businesses. Perhaps most remarkably, some executives have even tried to claim that options with exercise prices at or above the current market price - what we call 'out-of-the-money' options - have no value at all when issued. This is simply not facing up to reality. The lack of logic in option accounting isn't accidental - it's the result of sustained pressure from executives who want to hide these costs from their profit statements. What we're seeing is a clear case of let's-not-face-up-to-reality behavior by executives and accountants. Even when options are structured properly, they're still being accounted for in ways that make absolutely no sense. The whole situation shows how far some businesses will go to avoid transparent financial reporting."

Look, our accounting system is already full of imprecision. When we account for a 747's depreciation, nobody knows exactly how long that plane will last. Banks make estimates all the time about loan losses. Property-casualty companies - and I know a thing or two about insurance - their loss estimates are notoriously imprecise. But we still account for all of these costs. The principle is simple: when you deliver something of value to another party, that's a cost - whether cash changes hands or not. The solution isn't to ignore these costs. The right approach is to have honest, experienced people make their best estimates and record them. And let me tell you - options really aren't that difficult to value, even with their restrictions. What makes options so special that they should be the only major cost item we pretend doesn't exist?"

If options truly have no cost, that should be a fantastic deal, right? But here's the reality - shareholders need to understand that costs occur when companies deliver something of value to another party. It doesn't matter whether cash changes hands or not. Think about it - when we give executives stock options, we're giving them something of real value. Those options represent a claim on shareholders' equity, and that has a cost, just as real as any cash expense. The fact that we might pay for something with options instead of cash doesn't make the cost disappear - it just changes the form of payment. This kind of accounting sleight-of-hand might make earnings look better on paper, but it doesn't change the economic reality of what's happening."

In fact, I'm so confident about our ability to value options that I'll make you an offer right now: Berkshire will pay any executive who receives restricted options a substantial sum for the right to their future gains, even if those options are currently out of the money. You know, it's actually quite interesting - we have far more confidence in our ability to properly price these options than we do in determining something like the right depreciation rate for our corporate jet. So when someone tells you these options can't be valued, send them my way. We'll be happy to put a price on them."

And if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go? These are pretty straightforward questions that deserve straightforward answers. But there's an even bigger issue at stake here. When business leaders lobby for these kinds of incredible positions on issues that directly benefit themselves, they risk something very valuable - their credibility. This concerns me because the business community often has important things to say about significant societal issues. But how can we expect the public to take us seriously on those broader matters when we're arguing for such obviously self-serving accounting treatments? The business elite is really shooting itself in the foot here, and that's a shame because it diminishes our voice on other important matters where we might actually have something valuable to contribute."

You see, it's hard to teach a new dog old tricks. When you have exceptional managers who are delivering results superior to their younger competitors, that's incredibly valuable. Mrs. B's story really drives this home. Even after selling 80% of Nebraska Furniture Mart to us in 1983, she kept working as Chairman. When she had a disagreement in 1989, she didn't retire - she started a whole new operation next door! That's the kind of spirit and capability I admire.

Sure enough, when she left in 1989 due to a managerial disagreement, she opened up her own competing operation right next door. Now, I've always been a fan of Mrs. B, whether she was our partner or competitor - her business story truly has no parallel. But as I learned, partner is definitely better than competitor. When she decided to sell her building to NFM and link up with us again, she graciously offered a non-compete agreement, and this time I snapped at the deal. It's a perfect example of learning from experience while maintaining strong relationships. You can admire and respect someone tremendously while still being prudent in your business arrangements with them."

No legal department, no PR department, no strategic planning department, and except for Verne, zero consultants. Now, compare that to companies where corporate expense runs 10% or more of operating earnings. Here's the math that really matters: If two businesses have identical operating earnings, but one spends 10% on headquarters' costs while the other spends 1%, shareholders of the first company suffer a 9% loss in value purely due to overhead bloat. Charlie and I have looked at countless companies over the decades, and we've never seen any correlation between high corporate costs and good corporate performance. It's usually quite the opposite. The tithing that operations make to headquarters doesn't just hurt current earnings - it permanently impairs capital values. That's why we're almost fanatical about keeping overhead low at Berkshire."

The thought of retiring our plane is even more revolting to me now than the thought of retiring as Chairman, and that's saying something! But here's the important lesson: While having strong business principles is crucial, being dogmatic to the point of hurting the business isn't smart. The key is to distinguish between core principles that should never be compromised - like keeping corporate overhead low and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy - and practical decisions that might need to evolve as circumstances change. In our case, we still maintain incredibly lean operations. Professor Parkinson would approve of our structure, though Charlie still thinks we're outrageously fat. The jet is a tool that helps us operate efficiently, but it hasn't changed our fundamental philosophy about avoiding corporate bloat and unnecessary expenses."

That's real money being wasted. We've always favored the simpler, low-cost operation model. Look at companies like Wal-Mart, Nucor, and GEICO - these are perfect examples of businesses that keep things lean and efficient. They've proven that you don't need fancy headquarters and layers of bureaucracy to run a successful operation. In fact, we've found that the companies with simpler structures tend to operate more effectively than their more bureaucratic counterparts. It's just common sense - the more layers you add, the more complicated and expensive things get, without adding corresponding value."

        "from": "gpt",

The tax rules create a clear distinction between gifts of $10,000 or under, which are completely tax-free, and those above $10,000, which require using up part of your lifetime exemption or potentially paying gift taxes. Let me share two specific strategies that can help. First, if you're married, you have a very simple solution - you can actually give up to $20,000 annually to a single recipient. The only requirement here is that you'll need to file a gift tax return that includes your spouse's written consent to the gifts made during that year. Second, any shareholder, whether married or not, can use what we call a bargain sale approach. For instance, if Berkshire is trading at $12,000 and you want to make just a $10,000 gift, you can structure it accordingly. These are perfectly legitimate ways to manage the gift tax implications while still achieving your charitable or family giving goals."

Our shareholders think and act like true business owners - they take a long-term view and understand the business much as Charlie and I do. This alignment of interests is crucial. The result? Our stock consistently trades at prices that reasonably reflect its intrinsic value. We don't see the kind of irrational price swings that many other companies experience.

At Berkshire, we have what I believe is the lowest turnover rate of any widely-held American company, and this creates a significant advantage for our shareholders. Here's why: trading activity creates what I call frictional costs - think of it as a kind of tax on shareholders. Every time shares change hands, there are transaction costs involved. At most companies, these frictional costs are substantial and act as a continuous drain on shareholder value. But at Berkshire, these costs are virtually non-existent. We're fortunate to have Jim Maguire as our NYSE specialist, and his market-making skills help keep these costs extremely low. So when you own Berkshire shares, you're not losing value to excessive trading activity. It's another example of how our policies and practices align with our goal of maximizing long-term value for our shareholders."
