        "value": "Well, let me explain this clearly because it's an important distinction. Book value is simply an accounting term measuring the capital, including retained earnings, that's been put into a business. Intrinsic value, on the other hand, is something quite different - it's our estimate of the present value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Now, at most companies, these two values have little to do with each other. But Berkshire is different, and that's what makes us special. In our case, while our book value is significantly below our intrinsic value, it actually serves as a useful tracking device for that key figure. For instance, in 1993, both our book value and intrinsic value grew by about 14%. That's not spectacular, but it shows how these measures tend to move together in our case. The reason this matters is that while book value is easily calculated, intrinsic value is what really counts for investors. Having book value as a reliable proxy for tracking intrinsic value movements gives our shareholders a useful tool that most other companies' investors don't have."

Over the long term, market price and intrinsic value will eventually arrive at about the same destination - that's just how markets work. But in the short run, these two can diverge significantly, and we've seen this play out in interesting ways. Let me give you a concrete example from our own experience. Look at what happened with two of our large holdings, Coca-Cola and Gillette. Two years ago, these companies saw their market prices increase far more dramatically than their earnings gains would justify. I warned in our 1991 Annual Report that this couldn't continue indefinitely - the stocks couldn't keep outperforming their underlying businesses forever. And sure enough, from 1991 to 1993, while Coke and Gillette increased their annual operating earnings per share impressively - by 38% and 37% respectively - their market prices only moved up by 11% and 6%. This is a perfect illustration of how businesses can actually outperform their stocks, which was partly due to Wall Street's changing attitude toward brand names. The key lesson here is that while market prices can swing widely in the short term, they ultimately must reflect the intrinsic value of the underlying business."

From 1991 to 1993, we saw Coke increase their annual operating earnings per share by 38%, but the stock only moved up 11%. Now, you might think that's a problem, but it really isn't. What matters - and I want to emphasize this - is the earnings performance of these companies over time. Look at Coke's history: It went public in 1919 at $40 per share, and by the end of 1920, the market had knocked it down to $19.50. But by 1993, that single share, with dividends reinvested, was worth more than $2.1 million. As my mentor Ben Graham said, and I think this is crucial: 'In the short-run, the market is a voting machine - reflecting a voter-registration test that requires only money, not intelligence or emotional stability - but in the long-run, the market is a weighing machine.' That's really what you need to understand. The market will do whatever it wants in the short term, but over time, it's the business performance that counts. If companies like Coke prosper, Berkshire will prosper too, though not necessarily in perfect sync."

Now, here's the important part - in a world of 6% or 7% long-term interest rates, Berkshire's market price made sense, but - and this is a huge if - only if Charlie Munger and I can achieve our long-standing goal of increasing Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value at an average annual rate of 15%. We haven't backed away from this goal. It's important to understand that market performance in any given year isn't as meaningful as our ability to consistently increase intrinsic value over time. That's what we focus on at Berkshire. We don't get too excited about short-term market movements, up or down. What matters is whether we can continue to build value in the business at a satisfactory rate over the long term."

The key is that we focus on two things: the economic characteristics of businesses we want to own and the personal characteristics of the managers we want to work with. Then we hope we get lucky and find both in one package, which we did with Dexter. You see, it's actually quite dangerous when big companies get caught up in grand strategic visions about which industries they must be in. We think that's usually poison for shareholders. Instead, we stay flexible and opportunistic. When we see great businesses with great managers, we act - whether it's shoes, insurance, or candy. That's why I can now happily sing 'There's No Business Like Shoe Business' on my way to work, even though shoes weren't in any master plan we had.

Now, it's worth noting that they weren't interested in cash - they were looking for something else. Think about Dexter's position: here's a company that produces about 15% of U.S. golf shoes, excels at traditional shoe manufacturing, and has earned special recognition from major retailers like Nordstrom and J.C. Penney. They owned what I'd call a business jewel. But by becoming part of Berkshire, they got to participate in a broader collection of excellent businesses. This kind of exchange - trading concentration for diversification while staying within the realm of high-quality businesses - can make a lot of sense when you're thinking about long-term value. It's particularly compelling when you can maintain your connection to quality while spreading your risk across multiple strong operations. That's exactly what Berkshire offered them - a way to preserve their connection to excellence while gaining exposure to many other first-rate businesses."

Second, they now own a security that gives them tremendous flexibility - they can use it for charitable giving, personal gifts, or convert it to cash whenever and in whatever amounts they choose. This solves a lot of problems that come with owning a private business. You see, when you have a private company, it's often difficult to diversify outside your industry due to tax implications and other complications. Family members can also find themselves locked into a situation that may not suit their individual needs. At Berkshire, we can diversify with ease, and that's exactly what we do. While they may have given up control, they knew they'd be treated as true partners here. I've structured Berkshire so my interests align perfectly with all other shareholders - I have a huge percentage of my net worth committed to Berkshire shares for life, and I don't take restricted shares or stock options.

First, private companies often find themselves boxed in by tax considerations and other complications that make it difficult to diversify outside their core industries. That's just the nature of private ownership. But at Berkshire, we can diversify with ease - it's built into our structure and how we operate. When owners like Harold and Peter bring their business into Berkshire, they're solving this reinvestment problem in a very elegant way. They get to participate in a diverse group of terrific businesses rather than being concentrated in just one. And here's something important - while they move from controlling shares to non-controlling shares, they know they'll be treated as true partners. I've structured things so that my interests are perfectly aligned with theirs. I have a huge percentage of my net worth committed to Berkshire shares for life, and I don't take restricted shares or stock options.

Well, Charlie and I believe it gives a more accurate picture of what Berkshire is really earning. Think of it this way - when we own a significant portion of a business, their retained earnings are really our earnings too, even if GAAP doesn't recognize them that way. We're not including things like capital gains or special accounting items - we're focused on the real operating earnings of these businesses.

Now, here's where we differ from many other managers: We're putting the target out there first, before we shoot the arrow. Too many managers do it backwards - they shoot first and then paint the target around wherever the arrow landed. That's a practice we've criticized because it's essentially just making excuses after the fact. We prefer to take the risk of potential embarrassment by declaring our goals upfront. It's more honest, more accountable, and it gives you, our shareholders, a clear benchmark to measure us against. When we set these targets, we're essentially painting the target first and then trying to hit it, rather than engaging in the kind of target-painting gymnastics that's all too common in corporate America."

Now, if you look at the retained earnings during our eight-year holding period, even when calculated using our look-through method with a hypothetical 14% tax rate, they only amounted to $152 million. So what this tells us is that we ended up paying higher taxes than our look-through presentations assumed, yet still achieved gains that substantially exceeded the undistributed earnings allocable to these shares. This isn't just a one-off situation - we expect these kinds of pleasant outcomes to occur frequently in the future. That's precisely why I believe our look-through earnings provide a conservative representation of Berkshire's true economic earnings.

When you add in our share of federal and foreign income taxes paid by our investees, which was well over $400 million, you're looking at a significant total. In fact, directly and indirectly, Berkshire's federal income tax payments represented about 1/2 of 1% of all corporate taxes paid in America that year. Now, why don't we complain? Because we understand we're working in a market-based economy that rewards our efforts far more generously than it does the efforts of others whose output may be of equal or greater benefit to society.

Second, it simply fits our personalities - we're comfortable holding great businesses for the long term rather than trading in and out. And third, yes, there is a tax advantage since we only pay taxes when gains are realized. While we can't eliminate the tax penalty that comes with Berkshire's corporate structure, our long-term holding strategy helps mitigate it. Now, we could theoretically pay less tax if Berkshire operated as a partnership or S corporation, but that's just not feasible for us for various reasons.

But even with taxation, we still remain extraordinarily well-treated by the system. I'm quite direct about this because it's important to acknowledge these market disparities. We benefit tremendously from this system, and while that's perfectly legal and how markets work, it's worth recognizing that the rewards aren't always proportional to the societal benefit created.

You see, when Abner followed Old Man Mose's advice to double his money 20 times by constantly trading and realizing gains, he ran into what I call the tax drain. With a 35% tax rate like what Berkshire pays, even if you double your money every year, you're giving away 35% each time you realize those gains. So after 20 years of doubling and paying taxes annually, Abner would only have about $22,370 - nowhere near enough for his goal. In fact, he'd need 27 1/2 years to reach even close to his target. But here's the key point - if he had instead put that same dollar into one investment and let it compound internally for those same 27 1/2 years, he would have ended up with about $200 million pre-tax, or $130 million after paying taxes just once at the end. That's the magic of tax-deferred compound interest. The fundamental principle here is that tax-paying investors will realize far greater wealth from a single investment that compounds internally at a given rate than from a succession of investments compounding at the same rate but being taxed along the way."

First, he failed to anticipate Abner's slavish obedience to the instructions, where Abner literally picked up two dollars from his slot machine win instead of letting his winnings ride. Second, and more importantly, Mose completely forgot about taxes in his calculations. This is why I eventually dumped reading Li'l Abner and started reading Ben Graham instead. The point here is that even seemingly simple investment advice needs to be examined carefully for all its implications. You need to consider the practical aspects of implementation, the tax consequences, and the long-term effects of different strategies. In this case, the difference between following Mose's advice literally versus understanding the underlying principle of compound interest led to vastly different outcomes - $22,370 versus $130 million after taxes. That's why I've always emphasized the importance of not just getting advice, but truly understanding the fundamental principles behind it."

Float is essentially the total of two things: the money that policyholders prepay in premiums, plus the funds we've set aside for claims that have happened but haven't been paid yet. What makes float so interesting is that insurance companies get to hold and invest this money for a period - sometimes quite a long period. Take product liability or professional malpractice insurance, for instance. In these cases, we might hold onto these funds for many years before the claims are finally settled and paid out. Now, here's the fascinating part about float economics: historically, insurance companies could actually lose money on their insurance operations - running combined ratios of 107 to 111 - and still break even overall. How? Because they earned enough investment income from investing the float to offset those underwriting losses. It's like having a very large interest-free loan that, in some cases, you get to hold onto for years. The key is that even when we're paying out more in claims and expenses than we take in from premiums, the investment income from float can make the overall economics work quite favorably."

Think about that Appassionatta example I mentioned - when you're looking at a 27 1/2 year time horizon, the difference becomes quite dramatic. The reason is straightforward but powerful: when you're holding a single investment that's compounding internally, you're not paying taxes along the way that would reduce your compounding base. Each dollar that would have gone to taxes instead stays invested and continues to compound. This is why I've always emphasized the importance of long-term holding periods. It's not just about finding good businesses - it's about letting them work for you over very long periods without interrupting the compounding process with tax events. I suspect many of our Berkshire shareholders have already figured this out, which is one reason they tend to be long-term holders themselves."

Because they were earning good returns by investing this float. But things have changed dramatically. With interest rates falling substantially, the value of float isn't what it used to be. Let me be very clear about this - if you're running the same combined ratio today that you did back in the 1980s, you're actually running a much less attractive business now. That's why I always emphasize that you need to look at both the underwriting results and what you can earn risk-free on the float to truly understand the economics of an insurance operation.

This gives you the true economics of the insurance operation itself. The second piece - and this is important - is to separately examine the actual investment results that the insurer achieves from using both float and stockholders' funds. Now, when you're looking at how float moves from insurance operations to investment operations, you should value it based on the risk-free, long-term interest rate - that's your transfer price. I want to emphasize something here - the old metrics and year-to-year comparisons that worked in the past aren't as useful anymore because of how interest rates have changed. At Berkshire, we're very methodical about this - we calculate our float by taking our loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, and unearned premium reserves, then subtract agent's balances, prepaid acquisition costs, and deferred charges from assumed reinsurance.

But here's the catch - you'll eventually go broke. That's the trap many people fall into with super-cat insurance. They see the good years and think they've found a gold mine. At Berkshire, we're more conservative - we aim for something closer to 3.5-to-1 odds on our super-cat policies. But I'll be completely straight with you - there's no way for us or anyone else to calculate the true odds on these coverages with precision. We won't know for decades whether our underwriting judgment has been sound. What we do know is that when losses come, they're likely to be whoppers. We could easily see years where our losses are three or four times what we earned in a good year.

The 1993 Midwestern floods, while truly catastrophic, didn't trigger super-cat losses for a simple reason - very few flood policies are purchased from private insurers in the first place. This illustrates an important point about our super-cat exposure. When we look at potential catastrophic events, we have to understand not just the likelihood of the event occurring, but also how much of that risk has actually been insured in the private market. It's a bit like having a massive storm hit an area where nobody has storm insurance - the damage might be enormous, but the insurance losses would be minimal. This is why we have to be very careful in our analysis of super-cat risks. We need to understand both the potential for catastrophic events and the actual insurance coverage in place. The flood example shows how even a major catastrophe might not impact our super-cat business if that particular risk isn't widely insured in the private market."

They understand the value of holding onto excellence. Look at our holdings - take Coca-Cola or GEICO for example. We've held these positions because they continue to have durable competitive advantages and outstanding economics. The market value may have gone up substantially from our purchase price, but that's not a reason to sell. In fact, it's often validation that we were right about the business quality in the first place. When you find a business that's both understandable and has wonderful long-term prospects, the holding period should be forever, assuming the fundamentals remain intact."

But think about this - if you had invested just $40 in Coca-Cola back in 1919, the financial results would have been extraordinary. The key lesson here is that truly great businesses can continue to compound value for decades, even when conventional wisdom suggests their best days are behind them.

By 1993, that number had grown to 10.7 billion cases - a 50-fold increase from a company that was already dominant in its industry. And consider the returns: $40 invested in Coca-Cola stock in 1938 would have grown to $25,000 by the end of 1993. What's particularly fascinating is that Fortune magazine noted in 1938 that it would be hard to name any comparable-sized company selling an unchanged product with a record like Coca-Cola's. The remarkable thing is that even after 55 years, while their product line has broadened somewhat, that description still largely fits. This shows that when you have a truly exceptional business with strong competitive advantages, the fears of saturation and competition often prove unwarranted over the long term."

The academics' approach of measuring risk through relative stock price volatility leads to some really absurd conclusions. I'll give you a perfect example from our own experience: When we bought Washington Post stock in 1973, it had dropped significantly compared to the market. According to beta-based theory, this made it 'riskier' at the lower price than at the higher price - which is completely backwards from an owner's perspective. The academics, in their hunger for precision, have forgotten a fundamental principle I always try to follow: It's better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.

This increased intensity of analysis, combined with the higher comfort level you must feel before making an investment, actually works to reduce your real risk of loss. Think about it this way - when you know you're going to put a significant portion of your capital into something, you're going to study it much more carefully than if you were just buying a small position as part of a widely diversified portfolio. You're going to really understand the economic characteristics of that business. You're going to think like an owner, because that's exactly what you are. This might seem counterintuitive to those who preach standard diversification, but we've found that this focused approach, while it may increase short-term price volatility, actually decreases the real risk of permanent capital loss. That's because you're making fewer, but better-researched and better-understood investments. It's about quality over quantity, and deep understanding over broad exposure."

According to beta theory, this made it 'riskier' at the lower price than at the higher price. Now, if someone offered you the chance to buy the entire Washington Post company at that vastly reduced price, would you consider it more risky simply because the price had fallen? Of course not. That's why we focus on understanding the fundamental business rather than getting caught up in price movements. When we analyze risk, we want to know what the company produces, what its competitive position is, and how much leverage it's using. We don't need to know the stock's price history - that's what the beta purists focus on. Give me the business fundamentals any day. That's how a true owner thinks about risk."

Now, compare that to your average company selling commodity products - they're out there fighting for survival every single day without any special protection. As my friend Peter Lynch says, those commodity businesses should come with a warning label about competition being hazardous to wealth.

And here's what's really telling - they've actually managed to increase these market shares over time. Outside of Wrigley in chewing gum, I can't think of any other significant businesses that have maintained this kind of global power for so long. The reason this reduces risk is what I call the moat - these companies have built protective moats around their economic castles through their brand names, product attributes, and distribution systems. This isn't just about being big - it's about having sustainable competitive advantages that protect your business from the daily battle that average companies face. When you have these advantages, you're not out there fighting for survival every day like companies selling commodity products.

That's step one, and in an ideal situation, if they're successful, the board can use its collective muscle to make the appropriate change. But here's where it gets interesting - if that director can't get others to agree with them, they shouldn't just sit there quietly. They should feel completely free to make their views known to the absentee owners. Now, I know this rarely happens - many directors' temperaments just aren't compatible with this kind of critical behavior. But I see absolutely nothing improper about it when the issues are serious. Of course, they should expect a vigorous rebuttal from the unpersuaded directors, and that's actually a good thing. This prospect of pushback helps ensure that directors won't pursue trivial or irrational causes. It's a natural check and balance in the system. The key is focusing on substantial issues that truly matter to shareholder interests."

Now, what often happens - and this is a serious mistake - is that companies select directors simply because they're prominent names or to add diversity to the board. That's exactly the wrong approach. You see, selecting the wrong director is particularly problematic because these appointments are extremely difficult to undo. I sometimes say it's like getting a bad marriage without the possibility of divorce. The pleasant but vacuous director never has to worry about job security. That's why getting it right the first time is so crucial. When I look at boards, I also believe they should be relatively small - ten or less members - and consist mainly of outsiders. These outside directors have important responsibilities, including setting performance standards for the CEO and meeting periodically without the CEO present to evaluate performance against those standards. The consequences of poor director selection can haunt a company for years, which is why this process deserves far more attention than it typically receives."

When you have an owner-manager situation, especially one that might be facilitated by two classes of stock with different voting powers, the board's role fundamentally changes. In these cases, the board isn't really acting as an agent between owners and management - that traditional intermediary role essentially disappears. The reality is that directors in this situation can't effect change through normal governance mechanisms. They're limited to the power of persuasion. If the owner-manager is performing poorly or overreaching, a director's options are pretty limited - they can object, and that's about it. However, I do believe there's still value in having independent directors in these situations. If the directors who have no connection to the owner-manager make a unified argument, it can have some impact. But let's be honest about what we're dealing with - it's a very different dynamic than in companies with dispersed ownership, and understanding these limitations is crucial for both directors and shareholders."

If the independent directors present a unified argument, it might have some effect - though I'll tell you frankly, it probably won't. The owner-manager isn't likely to fire himself, after all. If the situation is serious enough and no change comes, that leads to the second option: resignation. Now, resignation isn't just walking away - it serves an important purpose. It signals to the market that there are serious doubts about management, and it emphasizes that no outsider can fix the owner-manager's shortcomings. The reality is, unless the unhappy directors can somehow win over a majority of the board - which is both socially and logistically challenging, especially if management's behavior is just poor rather than outright terrible - their hands are effectively tied. It's a tough situation, and that's why I've always emphasized the importance of getting into business with the right people in the first place."

In cases like Hershey Foods and Dow Jones, where you have a controlling owner who isn't running the day-to-day operations, the outside directors are in a potentially very useful position. Here's what makes it work better: If directors become unhappy with either the competence or integrity of the manager, they have a direct line to the owner, who may also be on the board. They only need to make their case to a single, presumably interested party who can immediately make changes if the argument is persuasive. It's much more straightforward than trying to build consensus among a diverse board or dealing with an entrenched owner-manager. Now, that said, even in this best-case scenario, the director still has limited options if things go wrong. If they remain unsatisfied about a critical matter after making their case to the owner, resignation remains their only choice. But logically, this third case should be the most effective in ensuring first-class management, because you have clear lines of accountability and a controlling owner who has both the power and incentive to make changes when necessary."

They need to win over a majority of the board to take action, which is both socially and logistically difficult. In the third mode, which Berkshire will enter after my death, you have a vitally interested but non-management owner - either my wife Susie or a foundation. This creates a cleaner structure where the owner can ensure the selection of useful outside directors and, critically, make sure good advice reaches the right ears without being stifled by recalcitrant management. The key advantage is that if the controlling owner is intelligent and self-confident, they can make decisions about management that are truly meritocratic and pro-shareholder. Most importantly, they can readily correct any mistakes they make. This transition is designed to ensure Berkshire maintains strong governance even after I'm no longer running things, though I should mention my health is excellent and you're stuck with me for a while yet."

What typically happens - and I've seen this play out many times - is that directors convince themselves that by staying around they can do at least some good. Meanwhile, management continues operating essentially unfettered. Now, contrast this with having a controlling owner who isn't part of management. They don't face these social constraints or the burden of building majority consensus. They can select outside directors who bring genuine value to the board, and these directors know their input will actually reach decision-makers rather than being blocked by resistant management. The controlling owner can make purely meritocratic, shareholder-focused decisions without the organizational paralysis that often affects traditional boards. And here's the crucial part - when they make a mistake, they can fix it quickly. There's no need for complex board politics or consensus-building. It's a much cleaner and more effective system for ensuring good governance."

At those companies, charitable giving typically follows the wishes of the CEO, who's often responding to various social pressures, or it goes through employee and director matching programs. But at Berkshire, we've established our shareholder-designated contributions program. In 1993, for example, we had about 97% participation from eligible shares, resulting in $9.4 million going to 3,110 different charities. The key distinction is that we let our shareholders decide where the charitable dollars go. It's their money, after all. We make a clear separation between this discretionary philanthropy and contributions that are clearly related to the company's business activities. I believe this approach better respects the rights of ownership and gives our shareholders direct say in how their company's charitable dollars are spent."

We brought Susie onto the board a few years ago, and Howard joined in 1993. Now, let me be clear - these family members won't be managers of the company in the future, but they will represent the controlling interest if anything happens to me. We've also structured our board so that most of our directors are significant owners of Berkshire stock, ensuring they maintain a strong owner-orientation. You might have heard me talk about being prepared for 'the truck' - well, that's exactly what these arrangements are about. The goal is to maintain Berkshire's owner-oriented culture and ensure proper oversight of management even after my ownership ends.

Most companies make corporate contributions based on what the CEO wants, often responding to social pressures, or what employees and directors want through matching gift programs. But think about it this way: we've never found a CEO who thinks he should personally fund the charities favored by his shareholders, so why should shareholders have to fund the CEO's preferred charities? It's their money, just as it would be in a closely-held corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship. That's why we let our owners decide where charitable dollars go. And here's something interesting - this approach is actually more efficient to administer. Last fall, we needed just one borrowed employee from National Indemnity for two months to handle the instructions from 7,500 shareholders. I'd venture to say that's far less costly than the administrative overhead most companies incur with their matching gift programs. In fact, our entire corporate overhead is less than half the size of our charitable contributions - though Charlie insists I mention that $1.4 million of our $4.9 million overhead goes to our corporate jet, The Indefensible."

There's also substantial support for social services, with 411 gifts to religious social-service organizations split fairly evenly between Christian and Jewish causes, and 759 gifts to secular social-service organizations, with about 40% being youth-related. The healthcare sector also receives significant attention, with 261 gifts to 153 hospitals and 320 gifts to 186 health-related organizations like the American Heart Association and American Cancer Society. What's particularly interesting is how this reflects the diverse priorities of our shareholders while maintaining a strong focus on core community institutions - education, healthcare, and social services. This demonstrates that when you trust owners to direct charitable giving, they tend to support fundamental societal needs across a broad spectrum."
