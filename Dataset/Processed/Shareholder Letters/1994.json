Our formula itself isn't the problem - we still firmly believe in purchasing businesses with good underlying economics at sensible prices, run by honest and able people. That approach will continue to produce reasonable success. The real challenge is size. You see, we're now working with a net worth of $11.9 billion, compared to about $22 million when Charlie and I started managing Berkshire. That's created what I call the fat wallet problem. We now need to deploy at least $100 million in any investment for it to be meaningful to Berkshire's results. It's like trying to fill a bathtub with a thimble - even if you find a wonderful small opportunity, it simply won't move the needle for a company our size. So while our investment approach remains sound, our universe of potential investments has shrunk dramatically. We'll keep doing well, but matching our past rate of 23% compounded annually over 30 years? That's simply not in the cards with our current size."

As Charlie regularly reminds me, 'If something is not worth doing at all, it's not worth doing well.' This perfectly captures our philosophy. We won't compromise just because our investment universe has shrunk. Yes, it's frustrating that many good businesses we see are simply too small to make a meaningful impact on Berkshire's results - we need to deploy at least $100 million for an investment to be consequential. But lowering our standards isn't the answer. We'll continue looking for those good balls to hit - businesses with solid underlying economics at sensible prices, run by honest and able people. We might have fewer at-bats these days, but we're not going to start swinging at bad pitches just to stay busy."

Ted explained in his book that to be a good hitter - a .344 hitter instead of just a .250 hitter - you've got to get a good ball to hit. It's the first rule in the book. You can't swing at everything that comes your way. Charlie and I apply this same principle to investing. We wait for opportunities that are well within our own 'happy zone' - businesses we understand at prices that make sense. You see, many investors feel pressured to constantly swing at every pitch that comes their way, but that's not our approach. We're perfectly content to wait for the right opportunity, even if that means we don't make many moves. Just like Ted Williams wouldn't swing at balls outside his sweet spot, we won't invest in businesses or situations that fall outside our circle of competence. This discipline has served us well over the years, and we're going to stick with the approach that got us here. It's really that simple - we don't try to be everything to everybody or chase every opportunity. We just wait for the fat pitch."

They didn't affect our ability to purchase fine businesses at sensible prices either. In fact, we've usually made our best purchases when people were most worried about some macro event. That's why I say fear is the foe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist. Now, I can tell you with certainty that we'll see a different set of major shocks in the next 30 years. But we're not going to try to predict them or profit from them. These political and economic forecasts are just an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen. Our focus remains on identifying good businesses similar to those we've purchased in the past. If we do that right, these external surprises will have little effect on our long-term results.

Now, if you set aside all income and capital gains from those securities, our pre-tax earnings that year were only about $6 million. And while we had earnings from our manufacturing, retailing, and service businesses, they were practically wiped out by a combination of underwriting losses in our insurance business, corporate overhead, and interest expense. But look at where we stood in 1994 - quite a different picture. Our securities holdings grew to $18 billion, or over $15,000 per Berkshire share. And if you again exclude all income from these securities, our pre-tax earnings jumped to about $384 million. That's real progress in building our earning power over that decade. We didn't achieve this by trying to predict or profit from external surprises. Instead, we focused on identifying and acquiring businesses similar to those we've purchased in the past.

Now, that might not sound like much, but through Berkshire's 7.8% ownership, we have an economic interest in 21 billion of those servings, producing about $200 million in earnings for us. We see similar results with our Gillette stake, where our ownership gives us 7% of the world's razor and blade market, worth about $250 million in sales. At Wells Fargo, our 13% ownership effectively gives us a $7 billion 'Berkshire Bank' earning around $100 million. The beauty of this approach is that we're not limited to just a few of these rare gems - we can build a growing collection. These partial interests are absolutely crucial to Berkshire's success, and we get to benefit from the extraordinary results these businesses generate without having to manage their day-to-day operations."

Look at the numbers - we've grown from 5,000 to 22,000 employees during the decade, while maintaining a lean World Headquarters staff of just eleven people. Our pre-tax earnings in 1994 were about $384 million, excluding our investment income. My job isn't to micromanage these businesses - it's to identify great managers and businesses, then let these talented individuals do what they do best.

That's a nice, clean number - but it was actually misleading. You see, at that time, all of our assets were tied up in a struggling textile business that wasn't earning satisfactory returns. Those textile assets were carried on our books at values that didn't reflect reality - they were worth less both as an operating business and in liquidation. It was like that old Hollywood joke: 'Don't worry, the liabilities are solid.' The situation today is exactly the reverse. Many of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying value on our books. Take our holdings in companies like Coca-Cola and Gillette - those are carried at current market values, but our controlled businesses often have values far exceeding their book value. So while we continue to report book value because it serves as a rough tracking measure, it significantly understates Berkshire's intrinsic value. That's why I always emphasize that while book value is easily calculable, it's intrinsic value that really counts, even though it can't be precisely pinpointed."

But here's what really matters: when you own truly outstanding businesses, the kind we seek to own, they tend to increase in value at a satisfactory rate over time. That's why we focus on acquiring these exceptional businesses and holding them for the long term. We're not limited to just one or two of these rare finds - we've been able to build a growing collection of them.

Book value, while we continue to report it, is really just a rough tracking measure for Berkshire's intrinsic value - and it's significantly understated. What really matters is intrinsic value, which we define as the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Now, I'll be the first to tell you that calculating intrinsic value isn't an exact science. It's highly subjective and changes as your estimates of future cash flows change and as interest rates move. But despite this fuzziness, intrinsic value is all-important. It's the only logical way to evaluate the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Think about our holdings - companies we don't control, like Coca-Cola or Gillette, are carried at current market values in our books. But that's not necessarily their intrinsic value. Last year, we saw our book value gain 13.9%, and that happened to match the approximate gain in intrinsic value. But that's not always the case. The key is understanding that book value looks backward, while intrinsic value looks forward at what a business can produce."

When you look at a college education, its book value would be its cost - and to be accurate, you need to include not just the tuition and expenses, but also the earnings that were foregone by the student because they chose college rather than taking a job right away. But here's where it gets interesting - the intrinsic value of that education is something entirely different. To calculate that, you need to estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over their lifetime and subtract what they would have earned without the education. That gives you an excess earnings figure, which then needs to be discounted at an appropriate interest rate back to graduation day. Now, for this example, we're setting aside the non-economic benefits of education and focusing purely on the economic value. But you can see how the historical input - what you paid for the education - might be very different from the future output - what that education will actually be worth in terms of future earnings. This is exactly the kind of divergence we see between book value and intrinsic value in businesses. The historical cost or book value tells you what went in, but the intrinsic value tells you what you can expect to get out."

That gives you the excess earnings figure. But you're not done yet. You need to discount those excess earnings back to graduation day using an appropriate interest rate. That final number is your intrinsic value. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Sometimes you'll find the book value - what was paid for that education - exceeds its intrinsic value. That's a fancy way of saying somebody overpaid. In other cases, the intrinsic value far exceeds the book value, which means it was a smart investment. The key point I want to emphasize is that book value tells you absolutely nothing about true intrinsic value. It's meaningless as an indicator.

The company includes World Book, Kirby, Campbell Hausfeld, and several other operations that contribute significantly to earnings. I specifically chose to mention this acquisition because it's turned out to be a huge winner for Berkshire. What this demonstrates is that book value and intrinsic value can have a very different relationship than what appears on paper. When we paid significantly more than book value for Scott Fetzer, we weren't focused on the accounting numbers - we were looking at the intrinsic value of those businesses and their potential to generate earnings.

But here's the fascinating part - the business is now earning about twice what it did then. The intrinsic value has grown substantially even while the book value has decreased. You see, accounting rules required us to amortize the premium we paid, reducing our reported earnings and net worth. But these accounting charges have absolutely nothing to do with the underlying economics of the business. This is why I always emphasize that you need to look beyond the accounting figures to understand the true value of a business. In Scott Fetzer's case, the gap between its carrying value on our books and its real intrinsic value has become enormous.

What makes Ralph particularly effective is his character - he's forthright about problems and maintains a healthy balance of self-confidence without being self-important. This is crucial in business leadership. The key insight here is that just as in investing, business management doesn't require magical abilities or complex strategies. It requires focus, consistency, and good judgment in handling the fundamentals. Ralph's approach demonstrates that extraordinary results often come from doing ordinary things extraordinarily well.

Many managers get fixated on whether a deal is immediately dilutive or anti-dilutive to earnings per share. But this is dangerous thinking. Think about this: imagine a 25-year-old MBA student considering merging his future economic interests with a 25-year-old day laborer. Sure, for the MBA student who isn't earning anything yet, this would immediately enhance his near-term earnings - quite significantly, in fact! But would that make it a smart deal? Of course not. That's exactly the kind of short-term thinking that leads to poor capital allocation decisions.

The same principle applies in corporate transactions. At Berkshire, we've walked away from many deals that would have given us a nice bump in current earnings but would have actually destroyed value over time. You see, focusing solely on current earnings when the target company has different prospects, different non-operating assets, or a different capital structure is just plain silly. We prefer to follow Wayne Gretzky's wisdom: 'Go to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.'

But here's the rub - the shareholders of the acquiring company usually end up poorer, often substantially so. Why? Because the acquirer typically gives up more intrinsic value than it receives. As John Medlin, the retired head of Wachovia, cleverly put it, if you keep doing this, 'you are running a chain letter in reverse.' At Berkshire, we've seen this pattern play out countless times, which is why we're so careful about our acquisition criteria.

Then you add in these strategic planning staffs, consultants, and investment bankers asking whether an acquisition might make sense. It's really like asking your interior decorator if you need a $50,000 rug - you can guess what answer you're going to get. The combination is dangerous because when you have a CEO already inclined toward action, and you encourage them to make deals, well, it's like encouraging a teenage boy to have a normal sex life - it's not a push they need.

Now, the company has options with this excess cash. They can return it to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases - that's one path. But what often happens instead is that management starts looking for acquisitions. As John Medlin, who used to run Wachovia, pointed out - if you keep making poor capital allocation decisions with acquisitions, you're essentially running a chain letter in reverse. The money goes in, but value keeps shrinking. This is why capital allocation is so crucial - it's not just about generating cash, it's about what you do with it.

When our managers have excess capital, they first look to reinvest it in their own operations where it makes sense. Only when they can't use it effectively do they send it to Charlie and me. Then we apply these same principles to deploy that capital. We're trying to build per-share intrinsic value, not just empire build. It's really that simple, though not always that easy."

That would be completely capricious. A cash bonus or stock option tied to Berkshire's overall performance would disconnect the reward from the actual performance we're trying to incentivize.

They love to use the word 'alignment' in their proxy statements, but when you look under the hood, these plans often fail a basic test of real partnership. Take your typical stock option plan. The fundamental problem is that it doesn't account for the wealth being built up through retained earnings. The option holder gets all the upside but doesn't face the same downside risk as shareholders. At Berkshire, we believe in large carrots, absolutely, but they must be tied directly to results in the area a manager controls. We want our managers to feel both the pain and the gain of their decisions. That's why with someone like Ralph at Scott Fetzer, we charge a high rate for incremental capital they use and credit them when they release capital. It creates a real two-way partnership where the manager's incentives truly match the owner's interests. Without this symmetry, you're not really aligned - you're just creating a one-way street that can encourage risky or short-term behavior."

That's the carrot. But - and this is crucial - if the returns fall below our hurdle rate, it actually costs him money through reduced bonuses. This symmetrical approach creates a powerful incentive system. The beauty of this structure is that it makes our managers think like owners when it comes to capital allocation. If Ralph can't use additional capital to generate good returns, it actually pays him - and pays him well - to send that cash back to us in Omaha. We don't want managers hoarding capital or making marginal investments just to build their empires. Remember, a manager like Ralph could be hitting home runs in his division, but if Charlie and I are making mistakes elsewhere, why should he benefit from that? Conversely, why should he get rewarded if Berkshire as a whole is doing well but his operation is lagging? That's why we tie compensation directly to the results in the area the manager controls.

That manager can essentially do nothing more than tread water in their job and still end up with pretty lush gains. Here's what's even more concerning - and you won't find this spelled out in any proxy statement - there's actually an incentive for option-holding managers to keep payments to owners low because it increases their own potential profit. That's not alignment - that's misalignment. When we structure compensation, we need to ensure it reflects actual value creation, not just the passage of time or financial engineering."

Think about it this way - if you're spending time thinking about how to optimize some complex compensation formula instead of thinking about your business operations, that's not good for anyone. We also have to consider the ripple effects. When the parent company engages in irrational compensation behavior, it tends to encourage imitative behavior at subsidiaries. That's why at Berkshire, we pursue rationality in all instances.

It comes from several sources - loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance, and unearned premium reserves, minus various adjustments we have to make. What makes float so valuable to us at Berkshire is that we generate exceptional amounts of it relative to our premium volume. The key thing to understand about float is that its value depends entirely on its cost. If we can generate float at a cost below what we'd otherwise pay to borrow money, it's very profitable for us. But if the cost of float is higher than market rates for money, then it actually has a negative value. We've been fortunate that our insurance operations have been structured to generate substantial float at very favorable costs, making it an enormous winner for Berkshire over the years."

Here's how it works: Most insurance operations run what we call an 'underwriting loss' because the premiums they collect don't fully cover their losses and expenses. That underwriting loss represents the cost of float. Now, the key to profitability is pretty straightforward - if your cost of float is less than what you'd have to pay to borrow money elsewhere, you've got a profitable business. But if your float is costing you more than market rates for money, you've got a business with negative value. It's that simple. We measure this carefully at Berkshire, and we've been fortunate that our insurance operations have consistently generated float at a cost that's been very attractive compared to our alternatives for obtaining capital."

The thing is, any catastrophe big enough to trigger these policies is also big enough to potentially bankrupt many reinsurers. There's no point in buying insurance that disappears exactly when you need it most. Our financial position gives clients that certainty - they know Berkshire will remain both solvent and liquid even after an unthinkable catastrophe. The second key advantage is our capacity to write enormous policies that others simply can't consider. For instance, in 1994, when a primary insurer needed $400 million in California earthquake coverage on short notice, we could write that policy immediately. But I should also mention another crucial advantage we have: Ajit Jain, our super-cat manager. His underwriting skills are simply the finest, and his value to us is enormous. In a business that requires more judgment than standardized policies like auto insurance, having Ajit's expertise is invaluable."

Super-cat policies are small in number but large in size, and they're non-standardized. This means we can't rely on the mass of statistical data that's available for something like auto insurance. When you're writing auto policies, you have decades of data showing accident rates, repair costs, and driving patterns. But with super-cat insurance, we're dealing with rare, massive events like earthquakes - just look at our experience with the California earthquake in January and the Kobe earthquake in early 1995. These events don't follow neat patterns, and each policy needs to be evaluated on its own unique terms. That's why it requires far more judgment in the underwriting process. This is exactly why having someone like Ajit Jain is so crucial to our operation. His underwriting judgment is unmatched, and in a business where you can't simply plug numbers into a standardized formula, that kind of expertise makes all the difference. You need someone who can assess these unique, large-scale risks and make sound decisions without the benefit of extensive historical data."

Take that California earthquake policy we wrote in 1994 for $400 million. Nobody else would touch that kind of exposure on their own account. But we did it, and we did it immediately. Now, could this lead to some wild swings in our results? Absolutely. We could have a Long Island hurricane, a California earthquake, and what we call Super Cat X all hitting in the same year. But that's a risk we're willing to take because the long-term math works in our favor.

The traditional approach involves brokers running around trying to piece together coverage from multiple smaller policies, which takes considerable time and leaves the client exposed to risk they don't want. But we can quote these massive amounts the very same day we're asked. Second, and this is crucial, we can act immediately. When that primary insurer came to us in 1994 needing $400 million in California earthquake coverage, we didn't need to form a committee or spread the risk - we wrote the policy right then and there. This immediate, large-scale capacity is unique to Berkshire.

We'd love to increase our economic interest in these companies, but since we already own 100% of them, we simply can't buy more. But the stock market gives us a wonderful advantage in this regard. When you own shares in public companies, you frequently get the chance to increase your stake in businesses you already know and like. That's exactly what we did with Coca-Cola and American Express. This approach ties into my long history of building on past experiences. Look at my experience with GEICO - it started as 70% of my personal portfolio in 1951, and 25 years later, Berkshire bought a major stake when the opportunity presented itself.

You see, in the regulated airline environment, these high costs weren't a big problem because airlines could simply pass them along through high fares. They were protected by regulation. But when deregulation came along, everything changed - though not immediately. It's like a slow-moving disease that eventually becomes critical. At first, the low-cost carriers were too small to matter much. But as their capacity grew, they started forcing price competition, and that's when the basic rule of economics kicked in: in an unregulated commodity business, you either get your costs down to competitive levels, or you're finished. No amount of capital infusion - including our $358 million - can change that fundamental reality. I should have seen this coming, but I didn't do my homework properly."

But here's what happens in the transition to deregulation - and it's important to understand the sequence: First, deregulation doesn't immediately change everything. The high-cost carriers initially maintain their fare structures because low-cost competition is limited. This creates a dangerous illusion. During this period, as we saw with USAir, the underlying problems are metastasizing - that's exactly the word I used - but they're not immediately visible. The high costs become even more deeply embedded in the business. Then comes the real challenge: as low-cost operators expand their capacity, they force price competition. At this point, the high-cost carriers face a fundamental choice: either dramatically lower their costs to match the competition, or face extinction. There's no third option. Capital infusions like ours might delay the day of reckoning, but they can't change the basic economics. It's a perfect example of how market forces eventually prevail over artificial protections."

We invested in USAir, and while Seth Schofield worked diligently as CEO to address their cost problems, they faced a real challenge. You had some carriers getting labor concessions, others emerging from bankruptcy with fresh-start costs - as Herb Kelleher cleverly put it, bankruptcy court became like a health spa for airlines. The problem is compounded because employees with above-market salaries naturally resist reductions as long as their checks keep clearing. It's basic economics, but I failed to give it proper weight in our analysis. You can delay the day of reckoning with capital infusions, which is what we did with USAir, but you can't defy economic gravity forever. That's why we had to write down our investment to 25 cents on the dollar. The market is ruthlessly efficient at enforcing this principle in commodity businesses."

        "value": "Let me be very clear about this - we have a prime rule of investing that I think is absolutely crucial: You don't have to make it back the way that you lost it. This came into sharp focus with our USAir investment, where we faced a situation that could go either way. When we wrote down our investment to $89.5 million, we recognized two possibilities: either our preferred stock would have its value fully or largely restored, or it could become completely worthless. But here's the key point - we weren't going to double down or stubbornly stick to our original thesis just because that's where we lost money. That's a common psychological trap that investors fall into. They feel they need to recover their losses in the same investment that caused them. Instead, we focus on making the best decision going forward, regardless of how we got there. The money doesn't know where it came from, and neither should we when making new investment decisions. This is why we're always ready to recognize our mistakes and move forward, rather than trying to prove we were right all along."
