We're looking to build a collection of companies - both wholly- and partly-owned - that meet two critical criteria: they must have excellent economic characteristics and be run by outstanding managers. Our absolute favorite scenario is when we can purchase 100% of such a business at a fair price through a negotiated transaction. Now, let me give you a concrete example from 1995. We completed three acquisitions that fit this model perfectly: Helzberg's Diamond Shops, R.C. Willey Home Furnishings, and GEICO. These were exactly the type of acquisitions we desire. What's particularly noteworthy is that while these operations added over 11,000 employees and roughly doubled our revenues, we managed this growth without materially increasing our shares outstanding or taking on significant debt. And here's something I'm particularly proud of - we did all this while only adding one person to our headquarters staff, going from 11 to 12 people. As I like to say, there's no sense going crazy with bureaucracy."

I'll tell you why - 1995 was a year in which any fool could make a bundle in the stock market. And yes, we did. To paraphrase President Kennedy, a rising tide lifts all yachts. That's why I believe it's important to look beyond just the financial results. What really matters is what we're building at Berkshire. Our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $14,426 over 31 years, compounding at 23.6% annually. But in any given year, like 1995, market conditions can make everyone look good. The real test of our performance comes from our ability to make sound acquisitions and build lasting value, which is why I'm more excited about the three excellent businesses we acquired than I am about the market gains we achieved."

On one side, we look to buy 100% of excellent businesses through negotiated deals at fair prices. That's always our favorite. But we're also quite happy to buy partial ownership through the stock market when we can get pieces of outstanding businesses at attractive prices - what we call pro-rata prices well below full acquisition value. You see, by being flexible and pursuing both paths, we give ourselves more opportunities than investors who limit themselves to just one approach. It's like what Woody Allen said about being bisexual doubling your chances for a Saturday night date. We're Woody-like in our thinking - we want to increase our marketable investments in wonderful businesses while simultaneously trying to buy similar businesses in their entirety. The key is that both barrels of our approach focus on the same target: excellent businesses with outstanding managers. By being open to both complete ownership and partial ownership, we simply create more chances to hit that target."

But equally important is having outstanding managers running these businesses. You can't have one without the other and expect superior long-term results. When we find businesses that check both these boxes, we're ready to act, whether that means buying the whole company or purchasing shares through the stock market. We've demonstrated this over the years by building our portfolio through both approaches, as shown by our growing marketable securities per share and our increasing operating earnings from wholly-owned businesses. The key is maintaining strict standards on both criteria - economic excellence and management quality. We don't compromise on either front, because our experience has shown that these are the two pillars that support long-term value creation. That's why we're patient and wait for businesses that meet both criteria, rather than lowering our standards just to make a deal."

When we started, we had general goals about what we wanted to achieve, but we had no specific roadmap for getting there. And you know what? That's still true today. We remain similarly unstructured in our approach. What we do have are two key advantages that have served us well: First, we have exceptional operating managers who are deeply committed to Berkshire. That's invaluable. Second, Charlie and I bring decades of experience in capital allocation, and we approach this task with rationality and objectivity. But - and this is important - we face one major disadvantage that grows bigger every year: our size. In the early days, we just needed good ideas. Now we need good big ideas. And finding those becomes exponentially harder as we get larger. It's a challenge that increasingly works against our strengths. So while we expect to keep improving our results over time, we don't pretend to know exactly how that will happen. We stay flexible and ready to act when opportunities arise."

The marketable securities column grew from $4 per share in 1965 to $22,088 by 1995 - that's a 33.4% yearly growth rate. Our operating earnings, excluding investment income, went from $4.08 to $258.20 per share - a 14.7% annual growth rate. Now, we show these two columns separately for good reason. The first column reflects our investment activities, while the second shows what our operating businesses earned on their own, without counting dividends, interest, and capital gains from investments. And yes, there are some purchase-price accounting adjustments we've explained in previous reports - and I'll spare you that discussion unless you're particularly masochistic and want to read our earlier explanations. But the key thing to understand is that these figures represent real business value creation over three decades, even though we never had a specific blueprint for achieving these results.

You know, it reminds me of this story about a man with a limping horse. He goes to the vet and says, 'Sometimes my horse walks fine, sometimes he limps.' The vet simply replies, 'No problem - when he's walking fine, sell him.' In the M&A world, that limping horse would be marketed as Secretariat! The reality is, I'm completely baffled why potential buyers even look at seller-prepared projections. We never give them a glance at Berkshire. It's just like that old line from HMS Pinafore: 'Things are seldom what they seem, skim milk masquerades as cream.' That's exactly what happens in most acquisition presentations."

First, as our financial success has grown, finding good acquisitions has become increasingly difficult. It's a problem that directly erodes our strengths - the bigger we get, the harder it becomes to find deals that can meaningfully impact our results. Second, we face the same inherent problem that every acquirer does: the seller of a business almost always knows far more about it than the buyer does. Not only that, but the seller gets to pick the timing of the sale - and you can bet they're going to choose a time when the business is walking 'just fine,' as we say. We have all the same difficulties in perceiving the future that other acquisition-minded companies do. The difference is, we recognize these limitations and maintain our skepticism, which is why we're so selective about the deals we actually make."

        "value": "Well, I'll tell you something that might sound counterintuitive - one of our biggest advantages is that we don't have a strategic plan. You see, when companies have these ordained directions they need to follow, they often end up paying silly prices just to check boxes on their strategic roadmap. At Berkshire, we simply decide what makes sense for our owners. We have the freedom to compare any potential acquisition against dozens of other opportunities, including buying pieces of the best businesses in the world through the stock market. This comparison between acquisitions and passive investments is a crucial discipline that many managers focused purely on expansion don't practice. They get caught up in what Peter Drucker called the romance of dealmaking - it's exciting and fun, while running a business is really about handling enormous amounts of grubby detail work. That's why you see deals that make no sense - managers often prefer the thrill of deals over the day-to-day work of improving operations. We avoid that trap by staying flexible and focusing on value rather than following some predetermined strategic path."

The reality is that sellers almost always know their business far better than we do - that's just a fact of life in acquisitions. And they get to pick the timing of the sale, usually when the business is looking its best and 'walking just fine.' But we've developed some advantages to help balance this out. First, as I mentioned earlier, we can offer something unique: Berkshire stock that's backed by an extraordinary collection of outstanding businesses. This is particularly attractive to sellers who want to defer their taxes indefinitely while still getting value for their company. We also maintain our discipline by always mentally comparing any potential acquisition against other opportunities available to us. We're not forced to make deals to fulfill some strategic mandate. Instead, we can be patient and selective, only moving forward when the opportunity truly makes sense for our owners. This approach helps protect us from making deals just for the sake of making deals, which is a trap many other acquisition-minded companies fall into."

        "value": "Well, we offer something quite unique in the acquisition marketplace. When we offer Berkshire stock as payment, sellers get ownership in what I'd call an extraordinary collection of outstanding businesses. This is particularly appealing to individuals or families who have built up a fine business and want to sell, but don't want to trigger a big tax bill right away. With Berkshire stock, they can defer those personal taxes indefinitely. But it goes beyond just the tax advantages. You see, many sellers deeply care about what happens to their company and their people after the sale. They want to know their life's work will have a good home. At Berkshire, we provide that assurance in two ways. First, our managers enjoy extraordinary autonomy - we don't mess with businesses that are running well. Second, when I say we're buying to keep, that really means something because of our ownership structure. We're not going to turn around and sell or break up the business. That combination - tax efficiency, management autonomy, and our long-term commitment - makes Berkshire stock a particularly comfortable holding for sellers who care about more than just getting the highest price."

When you're working with a seller who truly cares about what happens to their company and people, you're likely to encounter fewer unpleasant surprises than you would in a pure auction situation. These owners tend to be more forthright about both the strengths and challenges of their businesses. They're not just trying to dress things up for a quick sale. We like this approach because it aligns with our acquisition style - we're looking for businesses with good economics and excellent management that we can keep for the long term. When sellers care about their legacy, they're usually more focused on finding the right home for their company rather than just maximizing their immediate payout. This often leads to more straightforward negotiations and better long-term outcomes for both parties. That's why I always say, if you own a business earning $25 million or more before tax and care about its future, give me a call. We'll have a confidential discussion, and even if the timing isn't right now, keep us in mind. We're never going to lose our appetite for buying companies that fit these criteria."

They had a wonderful business - a true industry leader with a proven track record. Sure, their product wasn't particularly glamorous, but it was profitable. Then they brought in these management consultants who pushed the fashionable idea of diversification. Remember, this was before 'focus' became the buzzword. They spent considerable money on acquisition studies and bought several businesses. And you know what the end result was? As the executive put it, rather sadly, 'When we started, we were getting 100% of our earnings from the original business. After ten years, we were getting 150%.' That's a perfect example of why we at Berkshire stick to our principles. We're not interested in diversification for diversification's sake. We want companies with good economics and excellent management, and we're never going to lose our appetite for those."

Let me give you a perfect example. In May 1994, right after our Annual Meeting, I was simply crossing the street at 58th and Fifth Avenue in New York when a woman recognized me. While we were talking, a man named Barnett Helzberg Jr., who owned four shares of Berkshire and had been at our meeting, stopped to chat. In those few minutes of conversation, he mentioned he had a business we might be interested in. That's how we do things at Berkshire. We're always open to good opportunities, and they can come from anywhere. We don't need elaborate consultant studies or complex acquisition strategies. What we need are good businesses with solid economics and strong management teams. And sometimes finding them is as simple as walking across the street in New York City."

Retailing is what I'd call a have-to-be-smart-every-day business, and that's what makes it particularly challenging. You see, retailers can't afford to coast - not even for a moment. Your competitors are constantly watching, copying, and trying to top whatever you do. Plus, shoppers are being pulled in every direction by new merchants with new offerings. What makes this especially tough is the relentless nature of it. You might have a great strategy today, but tomorrow you need another one. That's why we see this shooting-star phenomenon in retail - companies can have terrific growth and superb returns on equity for a while, then suddenly nosedive, sometimes right into bankruptcy. This happens far more frequently in retailing than in manufacturing or service businesses. It's like being on a treadmill that keeps getting faster - you can't just find a comfortable pace and maintain it. The moment you try to coast in retail is the moment you begin to fail.

Once you made that smart initial decision to buy the station, you could put a shiftless and backward nephew in charge, and the business would still do well for decades. Now, would you do better with excellent management like Tom Murphy? Of course you would. But the business could stay profitable even without top-tier leadership. That's the beauty of a have-to-be-smart-once business. But retail? That's a completely different animal. In retail, putting that same nephew in charge would be like buying an express ticket to bankruptcy. There's no coasting in retail - you need smart decisions every single day. That's why when we bought businesses like NFM and R.C. Willey, we made sure they had terrific managers who love to compete and have proven themselves over decades. And here's an important point: we let these managers operate autonomously.

You know, when people ask me about span of control or how many direct reports I can handle, I always say the same thing: If I have one person reporting to me and they're a lemon, that's one too many. But if I have great managers like we do now, the number can be almost unlimited. It's really that simple. The key is having the right people - managers like Bill and Sheldon. We treat them the way we'd want to be treated as owners ourselves. None of this 'I'm 100% with you - win or tie' attitude you sometimes see from corporate headquarters. When you have outstanding managers who think and act like owners, the traditional concerns about organizational structure become much less relevant."

Ben's classes were a personal high for me, and I wanted to learn everything I could about him. So I did what any eager student would do - I looked him up in Who's Who in America. That's where I discovered he was Chairman of Government Employees Insurance Company. At the time, it was an unknown company to me in an unfamiliar industry. But because of my deep respect for Ben Graham, I became intensely interested. This eventually led to our purchase of 100% of GEICO, which has grown to become the seventh largest auto insurer in the United States with about 3.7 million cars insured.

But here's the painful part: over the next 20 years, that GEICO position I sold would have grown to about $1.3 million. That's quite a costly lesson in opportunity cost. What this experience really drove home was the inadvisability of selling a stake in an identifiably-wonderful company. When you find a business with true competitive advantages and great fundamentals, like GEICO had, the best holding period is forever. I learned that jumping from one seemingly cheap stock to another can be a poor substitute for staying invested in a truly exceptional business.

After Davy retired, the company made what I'd call a cardinal sin in the insurance business - they seriously misestimated their claims costs. This led them to underprice their policies, which is about the fastest way I know to get into trouble in insurance. It nearly drove them to bankruptcy. But here's where the resilience part comes in - when Jack Byrne stepped in as CEO in 1976 and took decisive action, the company's fundamental competitive strengths were still there, just waiting to be unleashed again. I believed so strongly in both Jack's leadership and GEICO's core competitive advantages that Berkshire put $45.7 million into the company in the latter half of 1976. By 1980, we owned 33.3% of GEICO, and our stake grew to about 50% over the next 15 years as they repurchased shares. The lesson here is that even great businesses can make serious mistakes, but if the fundamental competitive position remains intact and you get the right leadership in place, they can come back stronger than ever."

In 1995, for instance, Tony and his team managed to push underwriting and loss adjustment expenses down to 23.6% of premiums, which was nearly a full percentage point below the previous year's ratio. That's what I mean when I say their moat widened. You see, when a business has a sustainable competitive advantage that others simply can't replicate, that's a moat. In GEICO's case, their operational efficiency creates a protective barrier that keeps competitors at bay. It's not just about having low costs for a quarter or two - it's about having a fundamental structural advantage that endures. That's what makes it an economic castle worth owning."

It arises in two main ways in our insurance operations. First, most policies require premiums to be prepaid, so we're holding onto that money upfront. Second, and more importantly, there's usually a time gap between when an incident occurs and when we actually have to pay out the claim. This creates a pool of money we can invest while we're waiting to pay claims. Now, what really counts in our insurance business is two things: first, how much float we can generate, and second, what it costs us to maintain that float. Think of it as borrowed money, but the cost of that borrowing varies depending on our underwriting results. That's why we focus so intensely on operational efficiency, like what we've achieved at GEICO. The lower our operating costs, the more likely we are to generate float at an attractive cost, or even a negative cost if our underwriting is profitable."

When someone buys an insurance policy, they pay us premiums upfront. But we don't have to pay out claims immediately - it often takes time to hear about losses and resolve claims. During that period, we get to hold and invest that money, even though we'll eventually need to pay some of it out in claims. Now, what makes float truly valuable is its cost. You see, if we can generate float at a cost below what we'd pay to borrow money elsewhere, that's incredibly profitable for us. The cost of float is essentially determined by our underwriting results - if we have an underwriting profit, our float actually has a negative cost, which is even better! We've been fortunate at Berkshire because we generate exceptional amounts of float relative to our premium volume, and in recent years, we've had underwriting profits, making our float essentially free money that we can invest. That's why I consider our insurance operations to be such a huge winner for Berkshire."

Here's how I think about it: If our cost of float - which is determined by our underwriting loss or profit - is less than what we'd have to pay to borrow money elsewhere, then the insurance business is profitable over time. However, if our float is costing us more than market rates for money, then the business actually has a negative value. It's really that simple. In our case at Berkshire, we've been able to achieve something quite remarkable. In recent years, we've actually had underwriting profits, which means our cost of float has been negative. When this happens, we get to add both our underwriting profit and our investment income from the float to our earnings. This is like being paid to borrow money, which is about as good as it gets in the insurance business. That's why we focus so intently on maintaining disciplined underwriting while maximizing our float."

Think of float as a form of 'free money' that has significantly boosted our performance. Here's what makes it special: while it technically isn't our money, we've been able to obtain this float on incredibly advantageous terms - it has cost us virtually nothing over the years. In fact, in 1994, we had $3.4 billion in float, and it actually generated profits for us rather than having a cost. Now, if we had replaced that float with traditional equity, we would have needed to issue many new shares of Berkshire stock to raise the same amount. The result would have been more shares outstanding, the same level of assets, and lower earnings - ultimately reducing our stock's value. This is quite different from many other property and casualty insurers who may have plenty of float but pay dearly for it, making their leverage a disadvantage rather than a benefit. The key is not just having float, but having float at the right cost."

Any company's profitability comes down to three fundamental things: First, what the assets earn - and I'm pleased to say we've done quite well on this front at Berkshire, consistently producing high returns on our assets. Second, what the liabilities cost - and this is where we've had a particular advantage that isn't generally well-understood. Our liabilities, especially our insurance float, have cost us very little - actually less than nothing in some years like 1995 when our float generated profits. Third, there's the utilization of leverage - that's the extent to which assets are funded by liabilities rather than equity. In our case, we've been able to use our float almost like equity, but without the cost that would come with issuing new shares. This has given us a unique advantage in that we get the benefits of leverage without the typical risks and costs that come with it. It's important to understand that this combination isn't easy to replicate - many other insurers have float but pay too much for it, which turns leverage from an advantage into a disadvantage."

You see, most managers prefer smooth earnings - they'd rather have a steady 12% than a lumpy 15%. But Charlie and I think differently. We're perfectly willing to accept more volatile results if it means better long-term earnings. This gives us a real competitive advantage in the market. We can write policies with limits larger than anyone else, and we can do it faster too. We've even offered a policy where we could have lost $1 billion, though the largest actually accepted was $400 million. Now, this doesn't mean we're reckless - we carefully monitor our aggregate exposure to keep our worst case at a comfortable level. In fact, our worst case from a once-in-a-century super-cat is actually less severe relative to our net worth than what many well-known primary insurers face. Our financial strength is unmatched, and insureds know we can and will pay our losses under the most adverse circumstances. That's why we're sought out for many kinds of insurance, both super-cat and large single-risk coverage."

You see, most of our competitors are tied up in reinsurance treaties that, while protecting them from shock losses, significantly slow down their ability to react. We don't have those constraints. Just as Berkshire moves quickly to seize investment and acquisition opportunities, we respond with exceptional speed in insurance. We can supply quotes faster than anyone in the business. This matters tremendously to clients who need large-scale coverage quickly. Our financial strength also plays into this flexibility - we don't need to check with reinsurers or get multiple approvals to take on major risks. When a client needs coverage, even for hundreds of millions of dollars, we can make that decision rapidly. In fact, large coverages don't frighten us - they actually intensify our interest. This combination of speed, financial strength, and appetite for large risks creates a unique position for us in the market. Clients know we can not only write the policy quickly, but we also have the financial capacity to pay any claims, even under the most adverse circumstances. That's why we're often the first call for both super-cat and large single-risk coverage."

You see, while we write some very large individual policies, we keep them capped at levels we can handle. The primary companies might look safer writing lots of small policies, but when you add them all up, they're actually taking on staggering amounts of risk. In a truly catastrophic event - what we call the 'big one' - those losses could blow right through their reinsurance protection and threaten their very survival. We've structured things differently. Sure, we could face large losses, but they're capped at levels that wouldn't keep me up at night. That's a fundamental difference in our approach - we want to be absolutely certain we can handle our worst-case scenario, rather than just hoping it never happens."

I've often said that a bad reinsurance contract is like hell: easy to enter and impossible to exit. This isn't just theoretical - Berkshire paid a heavy tuition for my education in this business, and GEICO had a similar disastrous experience in the early 1980s when they enthusiastically jumped into reinsurance and large risks. Today, we see prices weakening in the super-cat field, which is understandable given the influx of capital and people's natural desire to put that capital to work. But we've learned our lesson - we'd rather sit on the sidelines than write policies at inadequate rates. Unfortunately, reinsurance students can't attend school on scholarship - the lessons are learned through costly real-world experience."

Even though their adventure was brief, they're still cleaning up that mess and will be for quite some time. The fundamental problem in reinsurance is often misalignment of interests. Look at Lloyd's - their troubles really drive home this point. You absolutely must have symmetry between the people writing the business and those putting up the capital. They need to feel the pain on the downside just as much as they enjoy the upside. When this alignment is missing, you're almost guaranteed to run into trouble, though it might take years to surface. I'm reminded of that story about the insurance CEO and the analyst - the CEO was moaning about low rates, inadequate reserves, bankrupt reinsurers, but then brightened up saying 'It could be worse - it could be my money.' That's exactly the problem. At Berkshire, we ensure it is our money at stake, and that makes all the difference in how we approach these risks."

Just look at our National Indemnity's traditional business - it achieved a combined ratio of 84.2 and consistently develops substantial float compared to premium volume. Under Don Wurster's leadership, this segment has maintained an average combined ratio of 85.6 over three years. These aren't just numbers - they reflect our conservative, owner-oriented approach. We've learned from the industry's mistakes, like GEICO's brief but costly venture into reinsurance in the 1980s. We understand that in insurance, you have to be willing to walk away from business that doesn't make sense, even if others are rushing in.

Now, contrast that with what we're seeing at the Buffalo News and World Book. These are what we'd call secular challenges - fundamental shifts in the industry landscape. With newspapers, we've watched their economic attractiveness decline notch by notch. While they still have excellent economics, their competitive strength is gradually eroding due to structural changes in the industry. World Book faces an even more difficult situation with competition from CD-ROM and online offerings - that's not a cycle that will simply turn around, but a fundamental change in how information is delivered. The key distinction is this: cyclical problems are temporary setbacks in fundamentally sound businesses, while secular challenges represent permanent changes in the business landscape.

I often think calling it 'work' might not even be the right word. These exceptional individuals simply prefer spending their time excelling at productive activities rather than pursuing leisure. Our job at Berkshire is remarkably straightforward - we need to create an environment that keeps them feeling this way. And our track record speaks for itself. Looking back over the period from 1965 to 1995, I can't recall a single key manager leaving Berkshire to join another employer. That's not an accident.
