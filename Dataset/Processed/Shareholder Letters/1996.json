My investment in USAir didn't exactly work out as planned. I was wrong in my analysis, overlooking the fact that the company's cost structure was a relic of a bygone era, and it couldn't compete in an unregulated market. It was a costly mistake, but one that taught me to dig deeper and not be swayed by superficial factors."
