You see, when the market is soaring like it did in 1997, everyone looks like a genius. I use the duck analogy because it perfectly illustrates this point. Picture a duck that's floating higher simply because of a rainstorm - that's like an investor taking credit for gains in a bull market. The duck might think its superior paddling skills caused it to rise, but really, all the ducks rose with the rain. The same applies to investing. The real measure isn't just how well you did, but how you performed relative to other comparable investments. In our case, despite our furious paddling in 1997, investors who simply put their money in the S&P Index achieved nearly the same results. That's why I say: Quack. It's a reminder that we shouldn't get too excited about gains that largely reflect a rising market rather than superior investment decisions. True investment skill shows itself over longer periods and through various market conditions."

        "value": "This is an important point about our performance dynamics. During boom markets, we often lag behind the S&P Index, and there's a very specific reason for this that involves taxes. You see, the S&P Index has a significant structural advantage - it bears no tax costs. The same goes for mutual funds, which simply pass through their tax liabilities to their owners. But Berkshire operates differently. In 1997, for instance, we paid or accrued $4.2 billion for federal income tax, which represented about 18% of our beginning net worth. That's real money that comes right off the top of our returns. Think about that - 18% of our net worth went to taxes. This is a crucial difference when comparing our performance to index returns. It's like running a race while carrying a heavy backpack - you might be moving just as fast, but the extra weight means you'll show up a bit behind someone running without any burden. This tax impact is particularly noticeable during strong bull markets when gains are larger. It's just one of those structural realities we deal with as an operating business rather than a pure investment vehicle."

Index funds and mutual funds have a natural advantage over Berkshire because they simply pass through their tax liabilities to their owners. Berkshire, as a corporation, doesn't have that luxury. Last year alone, we paid or accrued $4.2 billion in federal income taxes, which was about 18% of our beginning net worth. That's a real cost that creates a permanent handicap we have to overcome. Now, Charlie and I are straightforward about this - we won't beat this handicap every single year. But we do expect to maintain a modest advantage over the Index over time, and that's the yardstick you should use to measure our performance. We're not going to make excuses like that Chicago Cubs fan who said, 'Why get upset? Everyone has a bad century now and then.' We know we need to overcome the tax drag to justify Berkshire's existence, and that's exactly what we aim to do through our operating businesses and investment decisions."

Now, typically, these two measures tend to move roughly in tandem, and that's what happened in 1997 when GEICO had an outstanding performance. But it's important for shareholders to understand that our intrinsic value far exceeds our book value. This isn't just academic - it's fundamental to understanding Berkshire's true worth. That's why Charlie and I have included a table in our recent annual reports that traces our two key components of value. We believe this table is central to estimating Berkshire's intrinsic value. For those who want to dig deeper into this concept, I'd encourage you to look at our Owner's Manual, which lays out our owner-related business principles.

        "value": "Well, if you look at the numbers I've shared, you'll see something quite remarkable. From 1967 to 1997, our investment earnings per share grew at 25.6% annually, while our operating earnings grew at 24.2%. What's particularly interesting is how consistent these growth rates were across decades. In the decade ending 1977, investments grew at 24.6% and operations at 27.6%. Then in the '87 decade, we saw 26.5% and 24.1% respectively, and in the '97 decade, 25.5% and 20.8%. We started with just $1 million in operating earnings back in 1967 and grew that to $888 million. But here's the important part - and I want to emphasize this - these growth rates simply cannot continue at these levels. As I like to say, nothing recedes like success when you're deploying capital. Let me give you a personal example: Back in 1951 when I was in Ben Graham's class, a $10,000 gain moved my performance by 100 percentage points. Today, Berkshire needs a $500 million pre-tax profit to move the needle just one percentage point. That's the challenge of size, and it's why future returns will inevitably be lower."

While 1997 was an excellent year with operating earnings growing by $296.43 per share, or 70.3%, these results came with some important caveats that investors need to understand. First, we had unusually good luck in our super-cat insurance business that year. Second, GEICO's underwriting gain was well above what we can typically expect in most years. These were essentially tailwinds that we can't count on repeating consistently. Now, when you combine this with what I mentioned about the mathematics of size - where Berkshire now needs a $500 million pre-tax profit just to move our performance by one percentage point - you can see why I'm cautioning about future expectations. We're still allocating capital and growing both our investment and operating earnings, but the rate of progress in both areas is certain to fall. That's just the reality of managing a business of our size. It's important for shareholders to understand this because we want to be completely transparent about what they can reasonably expect from us going forward."

Back in 1951, when I was just starting out and learning from Ben Graham at Columbia, a single idea that gave me a $10,000 gain would improve my investment performance by 100 percentage points for the year. But today, at Berkshire's size, we need a $500 million pre-tax profit just to move the needle by one percentage point. That's why my results in the 1950s were better by nearly thirty percentage points than in any decade since. And Charlie had the same experience. You see, we weren't any smarter back then - we were just smaller. The mathematics of size work against you as you get bigger. That's why any performance superiority we achieve now will necessarily be minor. But we're fortunate in two ways: first, we have excellent businesses we've already allocated capital to, both our operating subsidiaries and our passive investments. Second, we have outstanding managers who aren't here for the money - most of them are already wealthy. They're motivated by the pure joy of achievement, which is exactly what you want."

What we do know is that when we commit fresh money at these levels, we're getting relatively little in prospective earnings. This is why we're taking what I'd call a Ted Williams approach to investing. Ted, in his book The Science of Hitting, described how he divided the strike zone into 77 cells, each the size of a baseball. The key is waiting for the right pitch - or in our case, the right opportunity. While we're delighted with what we already own, we're not particularly pleased with our prospects for committing incoming funds at current valuations. That's just the reality of the market we're dealing with. But here's what's important: we maintain our discipline. We don't swing at everything, and we're perfectly content to wait for the right opportunity.

You see, Ted figured out that by dividing the strike zone into 77 cells and only swinging at pitches in his sweet spot, he could bat .400. But if he started chasing those low outside corner pitches, his average would plummet to .230. It's exactly the same in investing. We have to exercise that same kind of discipline. Right now, the investment opportunities we're seeing are like those low outside corner pitches - they're technically in the strike zone, but just barely. If we swing at these, we're essentially locking ourselves into low returns. The challenge is that, unlike baseball, we don't know if better pitches are coming. Maybe those attractive prices we saw in the past were the aberrations, and today's full prices are the new normal. But here's the key difference between us and Ted - we don't get called out after three strikes. We can keep waiting for that fat pitch. Now, I'll admit, standing there day after day with the bat on my shoulder isn't exactly my idea of fun, but that patience is crucial to our long-term success."

Our primary approach is to park new money in very short-term, highest-quality instruments. Think of this as keeping our powder dry. Now, occasionally we'll venture into other types of investments that don't quite meet our ideal criteria. When we make these alternative commitments, we naturally believe they're more likely to generate profits than losses - we wouldn't make them otherwise. But here's the important distinction: these alternatives don't offer the same level of certainty that we get when we find a wonderful business at an attractive price. It's a bit like settling for a base hit when you're really looking for a home run. We're still trying to get on base, but we recognize that the outcome isn't as predictable as when we find one of those wonderful businesses selling at a great price.

If you're going to be eating hamburgers throughout your life and you're not a cattle producer, you'd obviously prefer lower beef prices, right? Same goes for buying cars - if you're not an auto manufacturer, you want car prices to be lower when you're buying. Now, here's where it gets interesting with stocks: If you're going to be a net saver and buyer of stocks for years to come, you should actually prefer lower stock prices, not higher ones. But what we see is quite peculiar - many investors get this completely backwards. They become elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall. It's like rejoicing because the hamburgers you'll be buying next week are getting more expensive! This reaction makes absolutely no sense. The only people who should be happy about rising stock prices are those who plan to sell their stocks in the near future. For everyone else - especially long-term investors and regular buyers of equities - lower prices are better. They give you more for your money. This is particularly true for Berkshire shareholders who don't plan to sell. The math is really that simple, even though the psychology seems to trip people up."

        "value": "Well, it's really quite simple when you think about it. For investors who are truly in it for the long haul - and at Berkshire, about 97% of our shares are held by the same folks year after year - declining prices are a gift. You see, Berkshire is constantly saving for our shareholders by retaining earnings and using that money to buy businesses and securities. The cheaper we can buy these assets, the better off our shareholders are. It's like getting a discount on everything we purchase. The same principle applies to our investee companies when they repurchase their shares. Take Coca-Cola, Washington Post, and Wells Fargo - their repurchases at very low prices in the past benefitted us far more than today's repurchases at higher prices. The math is straightforward: when prices are lower, the same dollar amount of repurchases buys a larger ownership stake. So when you see those headlines saying 'Investors lose as market falls,' you should mentally edit it to read 'Disinvestors lose as market falls - but investors gain.' Remember, every transaction has two sides - like in golf, every putt makes someone happy. For long-term investors, lower prices mean better opportunities to deploy capital advantageously."

That's because Berkshire does the saving for them by retaining all earnings and then putting those savings to work buying businesses and securities. It's a compounding machine that works on behalf of our shareholders. The beauty of this system is that it's completely automatic - you don't have to make any decisions about where to invest your savings because we're doing it for you at the corporate level. And we're doing it in a way that seeks to maximize long-term value. When we can make these purchases at lower prices, as we did so advantageously in the 1970s and 1980s, the benefits to our shareholders are even greater. Think of it as having a savings account that not only grows through regular deposits but also benefits from buying assets at discount prices. This is particularly powerful because our shareholder base is incredibly stable - that 97% retention rate I mentioned means most of our owners are truly long-term savers who can benefit from this compounding effect over many years. It's a system that rewards patience and long-term thinking, which is exactly what we're looking for at Berkshire."

When someone pays their premium to GEICO or our other insurance companies, we receive that money upfront. But we don't have to pay out claims until later - sometimes much later. During that interval between receiving premiums and paying claims, we get to invest that money. Now, typically in the insurance industry, this comes with a cost because the premiums taken in don't fully cover the eventual losses and expenses. That's what we call an underwriting loss, and it represents the cost of float. But here's the key thing to understand - an insurance business creates real value when its cost of float is less than what it would cost to obtain funds through other means. That's why we get excited about our insurance operations, particularly GEICO which is performing exceptionally well. The float concept is absolutely crucial for understanding Berkshire's intrinsic value.

As a corporate 'saver,' Berkshire is always looking for sensible ways to deploy capital - that's our job. But I have to be straight with you - it may be some time before we find opportunities that get us truly excited. Remember, for every seller there's a buyer, and what hurts one necessarily helps the other. Right now, we're continuing to look, but we're maintaining our discipline about finding the right opportunities at the right prices.

Now, here's where it gets tricky - and this is important for investors to understand. Insurance companies have enormous latitude in estimating their loss costs, which directly impacts their reported underwriting results. This makes it devilishly difficult for investors to calculate the true cost of float. I've seen some pretty amazing numbers get blessed by big-name auditors over the years. Even though an experienced observer might spot major reserving errors, the average investor is pretty much stuck taking the reported numbers at face value.

This gives us our float number, which is particularly significant because we generate it in large amounts relative to our premium volume. The importance of understanding float calculation can't be overstated - it's essentially the money we get to hold and invest that doesn't belong to us yet. Think of it as a loan, but the cost of that loan is determined by our underwriting results. If we have an underwriting profit, we're actually being paid to hold and invest other people's money - that's a beautiful business model when it works. And I'm pleased to say that for Berkshire, our insurance business has been what I'd call a huge winner.

Last year, we were very lucky because the world didn't experience any catastrophes causing huge insured damage, so almost all our premiums went straight to the bottom line. But that won't always be the case. This is a business that requires a very long-term view to properly evaluate. You can't judge it by looking at any single year, or even a few years. You need a great many years to truly measure its attractiveness."

A true bond obliges the issuer to pay, but these instruments actually put the payment obligation on the purchaser. The promoters created this structure to get around insurance licensing laws, but it has the unfortunate side effect of making these investments seem safer than they really are. You see, when innocent investors - and by innocent, I mean folks who are relying on what salespeople tell them rather than their own underwriting knowledge - buy these things, they often don't realize the true risks involved. The particularly dangerous aspect is that any serious mispricing might not become apparent for years. Think about it like throwing dice: if you're betting $50 million against collecting $1 million in premiums on a 1-in-36 chance event that only happens once a year, you might go quite a while before discovering you've made a terrible mistake. That's what makes these instruments especially pernicious - the day of reckoning can be very far off, but when it comes, it can be devastating."

Let me explain using our super-cat operation as an example. Last year, we were fortunate - there weren't any major catastrophes, so our premium income largely went straight to the bottom line. But here's the thing that makes catastrophe insurance different: you can be running what appears to be a very profitable operation for quite a while before discovering you've made a serious mistake in your pricing. I like to illustrate this with the dice example - if you're insuring against something with odds of 1 in 36, like rolling a 12 with a pair of dice, and you're only getting one throw per year, you could be collecting premiums for many years before the big hit comes. Even if you're charging far too little for the risk - say, taking in $1 million to cover a potential $50 million loss - the inadequacy of the pricing might not become apparent for a very long time. That's what makes this business particularly dangerous for those who don't truly understand the underlying probabilities and risks."

When you're taking in a $1 million premium to insure against a $50 million payout on rolling a 12, you might think you're making easy money. And you could go quite a while feeling pretty smart - there's actually a 75.4% chance you'd go a full decade without paying anything. But here's the critical thing: you're still significantly underpricing that risk. The true odds are 1 in 36, and eventually, that mathematical reality will catch up with you and you'll go broke. What makes this particularly dangerous in the real world of catastrophe insurance is that the calculations aren't as clean as they are with dice. When we're dealing with monster hurricanes and earthquakes at Berkshire, we can only estimate a range of probabilities. We can't be as precise as with dice probabilities. This fuzziness creates opportunities for promoters to bring in experts who'll tell you the odds are much better than they really are - like saying the chance is 1 in 100 instead of 1 in 36. And remember, these experts get paid upfront regardless of whether their predictions are right or wrong."

Here's what typically happens: A promoter brings in an expert to advise potential bond buyers about loss probabilities. Now, these experts don't put any of their own money at risk - they get paid upfront, and that payment is theirs to keep no matter how wrong their predictions turn out to be. What makes this particularly dangerous is that when the stakes are high, you can always find an expert willing to tell you what you want to hear. Going back to our dice example, they'll tell you the odds of rolling a 12 are 1 in 100 when we know they're actually 1 in 36. And here's what makes it even more dangerous - many of these experts actually believe their optimistic estimates. That makes them less reprehensible on a personal level, but it actually makes them more dangerous to investors who rely on their judgment."

So when you look at their standalone performance compared to their publicly-traded peers, you might think they're just average. But that's not giving them proper credit. These subsidiaries have been absolute champions at generating cash that we've been able to deploy elsewhere. Just look at the numbers - those three companies alone have sent us $1.8 billion that we've put to work in other opportunities. It's like having a group of highly productive workers who, instead of spending their paychecks on their own needs, give everything to the family treasury to invest in new opportunities. The public companies get to show the compound effect of reinvesting earnings, while our subsidiaries' individual records don't reflect the enormous value they've created through their distributions to Berkshire."

He took decisive action early in 1997, and by the critical Christmas season, we saw real momentum. That's the kind of management we look for. But here's something important to understand: when you're evaluating our businesses' performance, you need to look beyond the surface numbers. A casual observer might look at companies like Buffalo News or Scott Fetzer and think their performance is merely adequate compared to their publicly-owned peers. But that would be missing the bigger picture entirely. These businesses are performing at remarkable levels, especially when you consider they're paying out 100% of their earnings to Berkshire rather than retaining capital for their own growth like their peers do. They're achieving these results while essentially operating with one hand tied behind their back in terms of retained capital."

Now, this isn't because we were deceived or because the acquired companies performed poorly - quite the opposite. The sellers were completely honest during negotiations and have managed their businesses excellently since. The real issue is that we own such an extraordinary collection of businesses that trading away a piece of everything we own for something new rarely makes mathematical sense. Let me use that baseball analogy I often mention: If you have a player batting .380 on your team, trading him for even a very good .350 hitter is still a step backward. That's our situation at Berkshire - our roster is full of .380 hitters, so to speak. That's why our cash acquisitions, starting with National Indemnity in 1967 and including See's, Buffalo News, Scott Fetzer, and GEICO, have worked out so much better for us."

That includes our partial ownership in companies like Coca-Cola, Gillette, and American Express, plus all our fully-owned operating companies. This is particularly problematic because of the exceptional quality of our existing businesses. Think about it this way: when you own a collection of truly outstanding businesses, like we do at Berkshire, trading away a portion of them for something new - even something good - almost never makes mathematical sense. It's like that baseball team example - if you've got a lineup full of .380 hitters, trading away a piece of each of them to get even a very good .350 hitter doesn't improve your overall performance. That's why we've found that paying cash for acquisitions has worked out much better for us, as evidenced by our successful purchases of companies like National Indemnity, See's, Buffalo News, Scott Fetzer, and GEICO.

You see, we're in an unusual position at Berkshire. Our existing businesses are like a lineup of .380 hitters - they're exceptional performers. When you've got a roster that strong, it becomes almost impossible to trade up. That's why we're extremely careful about using our stock for acquisitions. It's like being in the opposite position of Camelot's Mordred, where Guenevere said the only thing going for him was that he had to marry up because everyone was above him. In our case, we're already at such a high level that marrying up becomes extremely difficult. So when we make acquisitions, we strongly prefer to pay cash, and even in cases where sellers insist on getting stock, we make sure to include an attractive cash option to tempt as many sellers as possible to take the cash instead."

Now, historically, Berkshire has rarely been overvalued, so that first condition doesn't often apply to us. As for finding undervalued companies to acquire in today's market - well, that's almost impossible. The second possibility - achieving synergy gains - that's usually unrealistic in our case. Why? Because our whole approach is to let companies operate after we buy them just as they did before. We don't go in looking to squeeze out operational efficiencies or combine operations. That's just not our style. So when you put all this together, it creates a pretty high hurdle for public company mergers to make sense for us. It's another reason why we're so selective about our acquisition approach and why we prefer straightforward cash purchases of excellent businesses that we can let continue to operate independently."

Now, most acquiring companies rush to claim synergies will justify their premium, because they don't want to admit their stock might be overvalued. But at Berkshire, we're very straightforward about this. We expect companies we acquire to operate just as they did before - joining with Berkshire doesn't normally raise their revenues or cut their costs. In fact, when we acquire companies that have been using stock options, their reported costs actually go up because we immediately switch them to cash compensation plans that show the true cost. You see, many companies have been following this standard but - in our view - dead wrong accounting practice of ignoring the real cost of issuing options. We believe in bringing these costs out of the closet and charging them against earnings, as they should be. So when you see companies constantly issuing shares for acquisitions - what I call voracious buyers - they're tacitly admitting their stock is overvalued. Sometimes they're really just running Wall Street's version of a chain-letter scheme."

When we acquire a business, we expect it to operate just as it did before we bought it. We don't count on some magical boost in revenues or dramatic cost reductions just because we've put our name on the door. In fact, sometimes costs actually go up after we acquire a company, particularly if they've been using stock options for compensation. That's because we believe in honest accounting - when we find a company that's been issuing options, we immediately switch them to a cash compensation plan that shows the true economic cost. It's about bringing reality into the open, not hiding costs through accounting practices that, while standard, are in our view completely wrong.

Second, we trimmed some larger positions as well.

And we've actually continued that rebalancing into 1998. Now, I should mention that when you look at our reported positions, sometimes you're seeing decisions made by Lou Simpson over at GEICO. Lou independently manages nearly $2 billion in equities, and while our portfolios sometimes overlap, he occasionally makes moves different from mine. That's perfectly fine - we believe in letting good managers operate independently.

Now, looking at what happened - interest rates did fall, satisfying our first condition, and returns on equity stayed remarkably high. Under those circumstances, with rates near recent levels, there's no reason to consider stocks as generally overvalued. But - and this is important - those high returns on equity aren't guaranteed to continue. They might not even stay close to where they are now. I'm reminded of what I wrote in Forbes back in 1979, when stocks looked cheap to me. I said then that 'You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.'

But here's the crucial point - today's price levels have significantly eroded what Ben Graham taught us is the cornerstone of intelligent investing: the margin of safety. When everyone's cheery and prices are high, that protective margin gets thin. It doesn't necessarily mean it's the wrong time to buy stocks, but it does mean we need to be particularly careful about our purchase prices.
