        "value": "Well, it reminds me of that saying about Wagner's music being better than it sounds - our 1998 progress, while satisfactory, wasn't as good as it looks on paper. Here's why: Most of that 48.3% gain came from issuing shares in acquisitions, not from our underlying business performance. You see, when our stock trades at a large premium to book value, as it does, any time we issue shares - whether for cash or in a merger - it automatically increases our per-share book value figure, even though we haven't actually earned anything. We're essentially getting more per-share book value in these transactions than we give up. But - and this is crucial - these transactions don't give us any immediate gain in per-share intrinsic value, because what we give and what we get are roughly equal. As Charlie and I always emphasize (perhaps too frequently for some), it's the per-share gain in intrinsic value that really matters, not the per-share gain in book value. That's why you can't just look at that 48.3% number and assume it represents pure business performance."

That's the number that really tells the story of what we've accomplished over time. Now, while 1998's 48.3% gain might look better on paper, as I mentioned earlier, much of that came from share issuance rather than business performance. It's important to understand that we have two classes of stock - our A shares, which are the original shares, and our B shares, which have an economic interest equal to 1/30th of the A shares. We introduced the B shares in 1996, but all these figures I'm quoting apply to the A shares. When evaluating our performance, I always encourage shareholders to focus on the long-term compound annual growth rate rather than any single year's results, as it gives a much clearer picture of our actual value creation over time."

        "value": "Well, as Charlie and I have said many times - perhaps to the point where you're tired of hearing it - what really matters is the per-share gain in intrinsic value, not book value. Let me be clear about this: while our book value might show impressive gains, like the 48.3% we saw in 1998, that doesn't always translate to equivalent intrinsic value growth. In fact, during that year, our intrinsic value growth, while substantial, fell well short of that book value increase. The key thing to understand is that intrinsic value consistently exceeds our book value, often by a significant margin. That's why when we look at transactions, we're focused on whether they deliver immediate gains in per-share intrinsic value. Many times, what we give and what we get are roughly equal in these transactions, so there's no immediate gain. We've provided a detailed discussion of these concepts in our Owner's Manual because we believe it's crucial for our shareholders to understand this distinction. It's like having two measuring sticks - one might be easier to read, but the other gives you the true measure of value."

On the positive side, our new acquisitions - General Re and Executive Jet - proved to be first-class additions in every respect. Our operating businesses exceeded my expectations in their performance, and GEICO - well, GEICO just knocked it out of the park, or as I said in the report, 'simply shot the lights out.' However, I should be candid about the challenges too. Several of our major public company investments faced significant operating shortfalls that weren't anticipated by either their management or myself early in the year. This led to our equity portfolio underperforming the S&P 500. But here's the important part - Charlie and I believe these problems are almost certainly temporary. We have strong conviction in the excellent long-term prospects of these companies. This kind of situation reminds us why we focus on the fundamental strength of businesses rather than short-term market performance."

Now, you might wonder how we could have such different results in these two columns, and the answer lies entirely with General Re. You see, General Re came with a very large investment portfolio, which gave our per-share investment figure a nice boost. But at the same time, they had an underwriting loss that year, which dragged down our operating earnings. Without the General Re acquisition, we would have actually seen our operating earnings increase modestly. This illustrates an important point about how acquisitions can affect different aspects of our business quite differently. Sometimes a deal might look great in one column while temporarily hurting another. But I want to emphasize that we're always working to increase both figures - we're not playing favorites between investments and operations. It's just that sometimes, certain strategic decisions will have different short-term impacts on these two aspects of our business."

Looking at our historical growth rates - we've managed about 25.4% annual growth in investments per share and 18.6% in operating earnings excluding investments from 1968 to 1998 - these are remarkable figures. But here's the simple reality: Berkshire's capital base has grown so large that it's now mathematically impossible for us to continue achieving these kinds of outsized returns. I like to inject a bit of humor here - if you think differently about this, you might want to consider a career in sales but stay away from mathematics. And remember, there are really only three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can't. That's my way of saying this is simply an immutable fact of size and scale.

When you're trying to compound returns on that kind of money, the universe of potential investments that can meaningfully move the needle becomes quite small. We're not in the business of running popcorn stands anymore - we need elephants, and big ones at that. Looking ahead, Charlie and I believe 15% is at the very peak of possible outcomes. That means we need to increase our net worth by $58 billion over the next five years. Will we have some years above 15%? Possibly. Will we have years that fall far short or even show negative returns? Absolutely. That's just the reality of managing a capital base this large.

While Berkshire has the largest net worth of any American corporation at $57.4 billion, that doesn't mean we're the most valuable company - not by a long shot. Companies like General Electric and Microsoft have market valuations more than three times Berkshire's. But here's the key point: net worth measures the capital that managers must deploy - it's the actual money we have to work with and invest. Market value, on the other hand, is what matters to owners - it's what the market thinks the company is worth. Think of net worth as the raw materials we have to work with as managers. And in Berkshire's case, that number has become huge - which circles back to our challenge of generating outsized returns. When you're working with a capital base this large, you need to find correspondingly large opportunities to move the needle on performance. That's why we're always on the hunt for elephants - major acquisitions or investments that can meaningfully impact our returns given our massive scale."

Let me put this in perspective: Berkshire and General Re together paid enough taxes to cover all U.S. Government expenses for more than half a day. That's quite something when you think about it. In fact, if just 625 other taxpayers had contributed what we did, nobody else in America would have needed to pay any federal taxes at all. But here's the key point - we've prospered in America in a way that wouldn't have been possible anywhere else in the world. Even if we could completely escape taxes by living somewhere else, I'm convinced we'd be worse off financially and in many other ways. Charlie and I feel extraordinarily lucky to be in a position where we're writing checks to the government rather than the other way around. You see, it's far better to be on the paying end than to need government support because you're disabled or unemployed. We've been dealt a very fortunate hand in life, and paying our fair share of taxes is part of that prosperity story."

First, there's this idea that we somehow prefer capital gains for tax reasons - that's just not correct. Here's the reality: Berkshire pays the same 35% corporate tax rate whether our income comes from capital gains or regular operations. In fact, our tax rate on long-term capital gains is actually 75% higher than what an individual investor would pay on the same gain. That's just how the corporate tax system works. Another misconception people have is about dividend taxation. Some folks think we can exclude 70% of all dividends from our taxable income. While that 70% exclusion rate does apply to most corporations, and it applies to Berkshire in some cases - specifically when we hold stocks in non-insurance subsidiaries - it's not a universal benefit for all our holdings. These are important distinctions that often get misunderstood when people look at Berkshire's tax situation."

We're willing to spend unlimited amounts on marketing - we committed at least $190 million in 1999 - as long as we're creating more than a dollar of value for each dollar spent. You see, many companies shy away from heavy marketing investments because of the first-year costs and how that impacts their short-term earnings. But we don't think that way at Berkshire. Our calculus is different. We're perfectly happy to spend more and more as long as we're getting good value for our money and can build the infrastructure to properly serve our policyholders. It's really just basic mathematics - if you can spend a dollar and get more than a dollar back in long-term value, why wouldn't you do that as much as possible?

        "value": "Let me be clear about this - we actually had higher profit margins than we wanted in 1998 at 6.7%. Now, that might sound strange to some people, but here's how we think about it: We have a target margin of 4%, and when we exceed that significantly, we take action to bring it down. In 1998, we saw an industry-wide decrease in both the frequency and severity of auto accidents, which helped drive our margins up. Our response was straightforward - we cut rates by 3.3% in 1998 and planned further reductions for 1999. The goal is to bring those margins back down, at least to our 4% target, maybe even lower. This approach aligns with our overall philosophy at GEICO, where we focus on providing value to our policyholders. And I should mention - this isn't just about price. We maintain high service standards too. In New York, our largest market, we had the lowest complaint ratio among the five largest auto insurers in 1997, less than half the average of our competitors."

Most of them - about 75% - are independently wealthy and don't need to work for anyone. They choose to work with us because we give them complete autonomy. We eliminate all the ritualistic and nonproductive activities that typically come with being a CEO. They're totally in charge of their schedules. What we do instead is give them a simple mission: run the business as if you own 100% of it, as if it's the only asset you and your family will ever have, and as if you can't sell or merge it for at least a century.

Well, insurance companies differ in their underwriting judgments. Some might give more credit than we do to drivers in certain areas or with certain occupations. But here's what's important: we believe we more frequently offer the lowest price than any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers. We've got another advantage too - in 40 states, we can offer a special discount, usually around 8%, to our shareholders. This combination of competitive base rates and shareholder discounts makes us a compelling choice for many customers. That's why I always encourage people to give us a call and check us out.

We don't have shareholders breathing down our necks about next quarter's earnings or pushing for short-term results. Instead, we can tell our managers to focus on building lasting competitive advantages. Now, don't get me wrong - current results are important, and we certainly pay attention to them. But we never want those current results to come at the expense of long-term value creation. Most public company CEOs simply don't have this luxury because their owners are focused on short-term prospects and reported earnings.

Think about what that does to decision-making. When you think like an owner and take that hundred-year view, you make very different decisions than if you're just trying to hit quarterly numbers. We also tell our managers something else that's crucial - don't let accounting considerations affect your decisions even slightly. We want them focused on what actually counts, not how it will be counted. Look at GEICO as an example. We've created an environment where Tony can focus entirely on what's important for the business. He doesn't have to waste time with board meetings, investment banker presentations, or talking to analysts.

The reality is that public companies face constant pressure to show smooth earnings, which can force them to make decisions that aren't optimal for long-term profitability. They might have to lay off good business through retrocessions or turn down profitable opportunities simply because they might create too much earnings volatility. That's not an issue under Berkshire's ownership. We're perfectly comfortable with volatility as long as it comes with the expectation of increased profits over time.

But here's where it gets ironic: public reinsurance companies themselves get punished by the market for showing volatile earnings. Their credit ratings can take a hit, and their P/E ratios suffer when they show the very volatility that is inherent in their business model. This creates a rather absurd situation where reinsurers often feel compelled to make costly moves to smooth out their own earnings - like laying off business through retrocessions or turning down good opportunities just because they might create too much volatility. It's as if a shock absorber manufacturer was being criticized for the up and down motion of their testing machines. At Berkshire, we recognize this contradiction and simply accept the volatility as part of the business.

Here's what makes us special: we're what I call a Fort Knox of capital. That means we can handle huge earnings swings without anyone questioning our ability to pay claims. Our financial strength is so robust that volatile earnings can't damage our premier credit ratings.

That creates what we call an underwriting loss, which is effectively the cost of that float. Now, when I'm looking at an insurance business, I'm very focused on whether it's creating real value. The math is straightforward: if the cost of float is less than what you'd pay to borrow money in the market, you've got yourself a valuable business. But if your float is costing you more than market rates for money, well, then you've got yourself a lemon.

While I can tell you that an experienced observer can usually spot large-scale errors in reserving, the average investor is really at a disadvantage here. They're largely forced to accept whatever numbers are presented. And I have to tell you, I've been amazed - and not in a good way - by some of the numbers that major auditing firms have blessed over the years. This is why at Berkshire, Charlie and I have always insisted on being conservative in our presentations. We've seen too many cases where optimistic assumptions turned into unpleasant surprises down the road.

Last year, he managed to earn $96.5 million after-tax on just $112 million in net worth, and did it with very conservative leverage. But it's not just Ralph - we have an unusually large number of individuals who are genuine legends in their industries. Some joined us through acquisitions, like when we bought General Re and EJA, while others we've developed internally. What makes them special is that they consistently deliver earnings at the absolute peak of what their industries permit, while simultaneously strengthening their businesses' competitive positions for the long term. When you add it all up, these managers have created many billions of dollars in value for our shareholders. That's not just good management - that's extraordinary stewardship of business assets."

This wasn't a halfway measure - they eliminated positions in about 250 common stocks, even though it meant incurring $935 million in taxes. Now, some folks might have looked at that tax bill and tried to find ways to gradually unwind positions or maintain some holdings to avoid the immediate tax hit. But that's not how we operate. When we make a decision, we make it clean and clear. We decided we wanted General Re's portfolio structured a certain way, and we implemented that decision completely and immediately. The only exception was the Cologne Re portfolio, which we don't manage. This 'clean sweep' approach might seem costly in the short term, but it reflects our commitment to making clear, decisive moves rather than compromised or partial decisions.

We had three such cases that I can point to. First, when regulatory authorities indicate they want public acknowledgment, as happened with our silver position. Second, when a position becomes so large it could materially impact Berkshire's net worth - like our zero-coupon bonds. And third, sometimes we simply need to let our shareholders know we're making unconventional commitments. But these are exceptions, not the rule. I should also mention that media speculation about our investments is usually wrong - people who make decisions based on such commentary do so at their own peril.

The rewards they'll receive for a given level of performance will be identical. But here's the peculiar part: while these plans are economic twins, the accounting treatment is completely different. Under current accounting principles, stock options are essentially invisible on the income statement - their cost is ignored when calculating earnings. But when we switch to a cash plan - which has the identical economic cost - suddenly we have to show a $63 million increase in compensation expense. This isn't because we're spending more money - Charlie's still flying coach, I assure you - but simply because the accounting rules treat cash compensation differently from stock options. It's a perfect example of how accounting rules can sometimes create very different pictures of identical economic realities.

Instead of having managers focus on stock price movements, which can be influenced by many factors outside their control, we want them to concentrate on what they can actually impact - the performance of their business operations. The economics of the new plan match the old option arrangement exactly, so managers can earn the same rewards for the same level of performance. We're not being stingy here - the past option grants are still outstanding. The key difference is that future compensation will be paid in cash rather than through new option grants. This aligns better with our philosophy of rewarding managers for the business results they actually deliver rather than stock market movements. It's a more direct, more logical way to incentivize the kind of performance we want to see."

Now, what do you think happens when you give executives that kind of choice? It's no surprise that the use of options has mushroomed. Let me give you a concrete example we used at Berkshire. Think about GEICO's $190 million advertising budget. If we paid for those ads with ten-year Berkshire options instead of cash, would anyone seriously argue we hadn't incurred an advertising cost? Of course not. But that's exactly what's happening with employee compensation through options - it's a real cost that simply vanishes in the accounting. Charlie and I have always believed that unrecorded costs are still costs, no matter what the accountants say. It's like that old philosophical question about trees falling in the forest - just because an accountant doesn't see an expense doesn't mean it doesn't exist and isn't hurting shareholders."

It's an economic reality that's often masked by the accounting treatment we just discussed. When companies implement these plans, they're making a choice that has a big downside for owners. The issue isn't the concept of options itself - it's how they're being used and accounted for.

We're businesspeople, and we deal in economic reality. When we're looking at an acquisition, we factor in the cost of replacing any option plan.

Some folks argue that because employees can't transfer their options, they're worth less to the employee than a publicly-traded option would be. But that's missing the point entirely. Let me give you an example I used earlier - if you give an employee a company car that can only be used for certain purposes, sure, that limitation makes it less valuable to the employee.

Sure, those restrictions make the car less valuable to the employee than if they could use it however they wanted. But here's the key point - those restrictions don't reduce what the company paid for that car. The same principle applies to options. Charlie and I have seen this impact firsthand in our analysis. When we properly account for options, we've often had to reduce reported per-share earnings by 5%, and sometimes even 10%. These aren't small adjustments - they're so significant that they've actually affected our investment decisions, sometimes causing us to sell a stock or pass on buying one we might have otherwise purchased.

Instead of supporting transparency, they've done the opposite - they've resisted it, even going so far as to lobby Congress, claiming that inflated earnings figures somehow serve the national interest. This brings me back to those three fundamental questions we posed years ago that still haven't been answered: If options aren't compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And if expenses shouldn't go into earnings calculations, where should they go? But here's what really concerns me - as bad as the option accounting situation has been, management's behavior regarding restructurings and merger accounting has been even worse. We're seeing a pattern of resistance to basic accounting truth in favor of fiction.

I've found the situation particularly egregious when it comes to restructurings and merger accounting. In these areas, we're seeing many managements deliberately working to manipulate numbers and deceive investors. And here's the thing - it's often done within the bounds of what's technically legal, which makes it even more pernicious. The rules and structures that should be protecting investors have instead created gray areas that some managers are all too happy to exploit.

Let me explain this with a golf analogy I find helpful: Imagine a golfer who deliberately records an awful score of 140 in his first game, claiming he needs to 'restructure' his swing. Then magically, he starts shooting 80s by only counting his good holes and charging the bad ones to that initial reserve. Wall Street plays along - they ignore that terrible 140 as 'discontinued' and focus on the consistent 80s.

It's essentially the same deception, just structured differently. This perfectly mirrors what some companies do - they defer recognizing their problems, show great results for a while, and then dump all the bad news into one quarter when they can't hide it anymore. Both approaches - whether front-loading the bad news or saving it for later - are really just different flavors of the same dishonesty.

        "value": "The golf analogy is particularly apt because it shows exactly how this financial manipulation works in practice. Think about it this way: you have a golfer who's playing alone with a cooperative caddy-auditor. Instead of honestly recording scores as they happen, they defer recording the bad holes and claim four rounds of 80 - pretty impressive scores that get them lots of praise for their consistency and skill. Then later, they turn in a fifth card with a 140 score - what we call the 'big bath' - to supposedly make up for all that earlier creative scorekeeping. Of course, they're not planning to return any of the money they won in the clubhouse comparing those earlier fraudulent scorecards. The caddy, who's complicit in this scheme, has now gained a loyal patron. This mirrors exactly what we see in corporate behavior - CEOs start with small manipulations, get positive reinforcement from the market, and then can't stop. Just like it's easier for the golfer to fudge the scorecard than spend hours practicing, it's easier for executives to play accounting games than focus on fundamental business improvements. The truly concerning part is that once executives start down this path, they rarely find the willpower to stop. They become addicted to these accounting games, which is why we see this behavior persist and even grow more sophisticated over time."

        "value": "Well, let me tell you what we see happening in the property-casualty insurance industry. When companies make acquisitions, there's this interesting pattern where buyers suddenly discover they need to increase loss reserves, often by substantial amounts. Now, while sometimes these reserves might have truly been inadequate, it's remarkable - almost magical - how frequently these actuarial 'revelations' happen right when a deal is being signed. What's really going on here? They're setting themselves up to release those reserves later as earnings. At Berkshire, we've taken a completely different path. We made a clear decision: if we're going to disappoint you, we'd rather do it with our actual earnings than with accounting games. In every single acquisition we've made, we've kept the loss reserves exactly as we found them. You see, we partner with insurance managers who know their business and are honest in their financial reporting. When you see these big immediate reserve increases in acquisitions, basic logic tells you that either the managers weren't knowledgeable, weren't honest, or - and this is often the case - the acquirer is laying the groundwork for manufacturing future 'earnings.' We simply won't play that game."

        "value": "That story about the two bank CEOs really captures something troubling about how corporate America thinks about accounting. Here you have these two leaders discussing a potential merger, and what's telling is their focus. The experienced acquirer is talking up the deal's merits, but the other CEO's immediate concern jumps to the potential for a huge charge - maybe as much as $1 billion. This perfectly illustrates how many CEOs approach these situations. They're often more focused on how to structure the accounting than on the fundamental business logic of the deal. It's worth noting that this conversation happened between senior executives of major banks - people who should be focused on creating real value. Instead, they're preoccupied with accounting implications. This ties back to what I was saying about CEOs finding it difficult to reject auditor-blessed strategies that promise increased future earnings. They're often more concerned with how things will look on paper than how they actually work in practice. At Berkshire, we focus on the economic reality of our decisions, not on how we can make the numbers look better through accounting maneuvers."

        "value": "Well, let me tell you what I've observed about this troubling practice. I recently heard about two CEOs discussing a merger where one actually bragged about making charges bigger than necessary - that's exactly the kind of thinking we need to eliminate. Just look at the numbers: in 1998 alone, there were 1,369 special charges totaling $72.1 billion for things like restructuring and merger-related items. To put that in perspective, the Fortune 500 companies together earned $324 billion in 1997. That's a staggering amount of charges. What we're seeing is a game of financial engineering where managers are using these charges not for accurate reporting, but to manipulate future earnings. They're essentially creating cookie jars of reserves they can dip into later. It's a business disgrace, plain and simple. When executives show such disrespect for accurate reporting, they're not just fudging some numbers - they're undermining the entire foundation of our financial markets. And unfortunately, the auditors who should be watchdogs for investors have become lapdogs for management, following the principle of 'Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.'"

The fundamental issue is that auditors have forgotten who their real client should be: the investing public. Instead, they've fallen into a pattern of catering to the managers who hire them and control their compensation. As I mentioned, it's a classic case of 'Whose bread I eat, his song I sing.' This has led to a system where auditors are participating in what SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt accurately described as 'a game of nods and winks.' But there is some good news on the horizon. The SEC, under Levitt's leadership, is showing real determination to clean up corporate America's act. His landmark speech calling for an end to earnings management was an important step. This is exactly what we need - strong regulatory oversight to counter the current business disgrace of disrespecting accurate financial reporting. The solution requires both better behavior from auditors and continued strong action from regulators. Without this combination, we can't expect to see the kind of honest, accurate financial reporting that investors deserve and markets require to function properly."

He hit the nail on the head when he said there's this game of nods and winks going on between corporate managers, auditors, and analysts. What's particularly troubling is that we're seeing managing giving way to manipulating, and integrity losing out to illusion. Look, this isn't just some academic concern - it's fundamental to how our markets function. At Berkshire, we've always believed in giving shareholders the straight story. I think every corporate executive needs to ask themselves: if I were on the other side of this table as a shareholder, would I feel I'm getting the full, honest picture? That's why I've been such a strong supporter of Levitt's efforts to reform corporate America's reporting practices. It's a massive undertaking he's taken on, but I can't think of anything more important for maintaining the integrity of our markets."

First, we provide exactly the kind of information that we would want to receive if we were in our shareholders' shoes. Second, we believe strongly in ensuring all our shareholders get access to information at the same time - no playing favorites. The Internet has become a tremendous tool for helping us achieve these goals. We've made our website, berkshirehathaway.com, the primary hub for company information. While we still send annual reports to everyone, we've moved to a system where quarterly reports are available online, with printed copies sent only to those who specifically request them. This ties directly into what Levitt called 'selective disclosure' - a practice where companies give preferential treatment to Wall Street analysts and institutional investors. We've seen too many companies crossing the line of fairness in how they handle information distribution. That's not how we operate at Berkshire. Whether you're an individual investor or a major institution, you get the same information at the same time."
