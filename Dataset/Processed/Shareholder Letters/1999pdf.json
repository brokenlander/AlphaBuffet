First, we could buy both businesses and stocks at far more attractive prices than we can now. The markets have become more efficient and the bargains are harder to find. Second, and this is crucial, we had a much smaller capital base back then. When you're managing less money, you have many more options. You can look at smaller companies and special situations that could meaningfully impact your returns. Today, with our large size, we need to focus on larger investments to move the needle. That's why I say we hope to beat the S&P 'modestly.' We're still aiming to outperform, and Charlie and I believe we will over the next decade, but the days of huge outperformance are behind us. It's just mathematics and market reality. But let me be clear - we're so confident in Berkshire's future that well over 99% of my net worth remains in Berkshire stock, and neither my wife nor I have ever sold a share. We're eating our own cooking, as we always have."

        "value": "The relationship between stock price and business performance is something that tends to work itself out over time. What we saw in 1998-1999 illustrates this perfectly. In 1998, our stock outperformed the business - meaning the market was perhaps too optimistic. Then in 1999, we had the opposite situation - the business actually performed better than the stock price would indicate. Some of our largest investments had disappointing operating results, which hurt our performance, and the market reacted with a more-than-commensurate drop in our stock price. But here's the key principle I want everyone to understand: over time, the performance of the stock must roughly match the performance of the business. That's not just my opinion - it's how markets work in the long run. You can have periods where these two diverge, sometimes significantly, but eventually, they'll converge. That's why we focus on the intrinsic value of our businesses rather than short-term stock price movements. When we see these divergences, they don't worry us because we know the fundamental value of our businesses will be reflected in the stock price over time."

The bargains that were available in the earlier days just aren't there anymore. Second, and this is quite important, we're now working with a much larger capital base. When you're managing as much capital as we are now, your universe of potential investments naturally shrinks. We just can't consider many of the smaller opportunities that might have moved the needle for us in the past. But let me be clear about something else - we're also quite certain that the S&P itself will perform far less impressively in the next couple of decades than it has since 1982. I've actually written about this in Fortune magazine, explaining why this is virtually certain. So while our relative advantages have decreased, we're still focused on running our existing businesses well - and we're fortunate to have outstanding managers in place who make that job easier."

Our approach to acquisitions is really quite straightforward: we look for businesses with strong economic characteristics and, equally important, outstanding managers who we believe will continue to run them well. When we find businesses that meet these criteria, we prefer to pay cash rather than dilute our existing shareholders by issuing stock. This ties directly into how we think about intrinsic value, which is a key measurement we use when evaluating both businesses and common stocks. While it's not a precise science, understanding intrinsic value is fundamental to our acquisition strategy."

You see, most of our managers are already independently wealthy. They've made fortunes in these businesses. They don't work because they need money or because we force them to with contracts - we actually have no contracts at Berkshire. They work because they genuinely love their businesses. Charlie and I believe in treating our managers the same way we treat our shareholders - exactly how we'd want to be treated if our positions were reversed. This approach has worked remarkably well.

Our managers, who are truly accomplished artists at what they do, feel the same way. It's fascinating to see how they approach their relationship with Berkshire - it reminds me of President Kennedy's famous words about asking what you can do for your country, not what your country can do for you. These managers have already created substantial personal wealth through their businesses. But they stay on and work incredibly hard because they have genuine passion for what they do. They're in charge of their operations - truly in charge - and that ownership mentality combined with their love for their businesses creates a powerful motivation that money simply can't buy."

But here's the key: these managers are accomplished artists at what they do. They've proven themselves. Bill didn't just talk about his convictions - he put his own money where his mouth was. He offered to personally invest $9 million to build the store, and we'd only buy it if successful. That's the kind of manager we want at Berkshire - someone who thinks like an owner and stands behind their decisions. They're not asking what Berkshire can do for them; they're showing what they can do for Berkshire.

That's not despite his principles, but while staying true to them. The key insight is that principles and profitability aren't mutually exclusive. Bill showed that by sticking to your core values, you can build customer trust and employee loyalty that actually becomes a competitive advantage. When he proposed the Boise expansion, he wasn't just making a religious decision - he was making a business decision based on decades of success with this model. And remember, he was confident enough in this approach to risk $9 million of his own money on the building. That's what I mean when I talk about our managers being accomplished artists. They understand that long-term success comes from having strong principles and the courage to stick to them, even when conventional wisdom says otherwise."

        "value": "Well, float is really quite simple - it's money we hold but don't own. Let me explain how this works in insurance. When we receive premiums from our customers, we don't have to pay out claims right away. Sometimes this interval between receiving premiums and paying claims extends over many years. During that time, we get to invest that money, which is a very pleasant activity indeed. Now, what makes float valuable or not is its cost. You see, typically the premiums we take in don't fully cover the losses and expenses we eventually pay out - that's called an underwriting loss, and that's essentially the cost of our float. Here's the key thing to understand: an insurance business creates value when its cost of float is less than what it would cost to get funds elsewhere in the market. But if your cost of float is higher than market rates for money, well, then you've got yourself a lemon. The tricky part - and this is important for investors to understand - is that calculating the true cost of float isn't straightforward because loss costs must be estimated. Insurance companies have enormous latitude in these calculations, and even with big-name auditors blessing the numbers, I've sometimes been amazed at what I've seen."

You see, insurance companies have enormous latitude in figuring their underwriting results because they're dealing with future loss costs that must be estimated. These estimates flow directly into earnings, and the errors - whether innocent or sometimes not so innocent - can be huge. Let me be candid about this: while an experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, the general public is typically in a tough spot. They're often forced to simply accept what's presented in the financial statements. I've personally been amazed by some numbers that even big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. This is why investors need to be particularly cautious when evaluating insurance companies. The financial statements might look straightforward, but there's a lot of judgment and estimation involved in those numbers. It's not like counting widgets in a warehouse - we're talking about predicting future events and their costs, which leaves plenty of room for miscalculation or, in some cases, manipulation. That's why understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone investing in insurance companies."

The issue with insurance reserving is that it's an area where large-scale miscalculations can directly impact earnings, and these errors aren't always easy for the general public to spot. I've seen cases, particularly in 1999, where some insurers made reserve adjustments that completely contradicted the earnings figures that investors had been using to make their decisions. Even big-name auditors have blessed numbers that, quite frankly, left me amazed. At Berkshire, we take a different approach. We believe in being both conservative and consistent in our reserving practices. That's absolutely fundamental to how we operate. However, I always want to be upfront with our shareholders - even with our careful approach, we can't guarantee there won't ever be an unpleasant surprise. That's just the nature of the insurance business. The key is to minimize those surprises through disciplined, conservative reserving practices rather than trying to make the numbers look good in the short term."

Looking at our track record, we've typically managed to achieve one of two favorable outcomes: either we have a small underwriting loss, which means our cost of float is very low, or better yet, we actually show an underwriting profit, which essentially means we're being paid to hold other people's money. That's really quite extraordinary when you think about it. You can see this in our historical float numbers, which have grown substantially from just $20 million in 1967 to over $25 billion by 1999. We calculate our float through a detailed process, adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, then subtracting various items like agents balances and prepaid costs. But the real measure of success isn't just the size - it's maintaining that disciplined approach to keep the cost of float at attractive levels."

Through 1998, our cumulative result was actually an underwriting profit, which is exceptional. Now, 1999 wasn't our best year with a $1.4 billion underwriting loss giving us a float cost of 5.8%. About $400 million of that loss we were actually happy about because it's tied to business that will give us exceptional float over the next decade. But I have to be frank - the rest of that loss was not what we wanted, and we have to judge that performance as extremely poor. It's like having someone pay you to look after their wallet - in good years, they actually give you a small fee to hold their money, but in tougher years, you might have to pay a bit to keep that privilege. The key is keeping that cost as low as possible, and that's what we strive for in our insurance operations."

What makes Ajit exceptional is that he possesses a unique combination of critical qualities that are essential in the insurance business. First, he has the intelligence to properly rate most risks - that's fundamental. Second, and this is just as important, he has the realism to completely forget about risks he can't evaluate. Third, he has the courage to write huge policies when the premium is appropriate. And finally, he has the discipline to reject even the smallest risk when the premium isn't adequate. This combination of qualities is extremely rare. Think of it this way - in the insurance business, you need someone who knows when to swing big and when to keep the bat on their shoulder, and Ajit has demonstrated this judgment consistently.

It's this direct, no-frills approach that has served us well. We don't need elaborate pitch books or auction processes.

You see, many of our deals now come about because a manager who previously sold to us recommends Berkshire to their friends. It's like having a team of satisfied customers as our acquisition department. And I'll tell you something funny about that Scott Fetzer deal - we had to pay the investment bank $2.5 million even though they didn't find us, and when they offered us their fancy analysis book, Charlie Munger said he'd pay $2.5 million not to read it.

Same goes for things like inventory obsolescence, bad debt charges, and warranty accruals - these are all trying to capture real economic costs, even if the exact numbers require some estimation. But goodwill amortization is different. In many cases - I'd say probably most cases - economic goodwill doesn't diminish at all. In fact, it often grows in value over time. I'll give you a concrete example from our own experience: at See's Candies, the economic goodwill has grown substantially, albeit irregularly, for 78 years. And if we continue running that business properly, that growth should continue for decades to come. So having accounting rules that force companies to amortize goodwill when that amortization conflicts with economic reality - well, that's deeply troublesome to me."

Unlike physical assets that we know will deteriorate, neither land nor economic goodwill has a built-in tendency to decline in value. In fact, as I mentioned with our See's Candies example, economic goodwill often increases in value over time when a business is well-managed. This is why the conventional accounting approach of mandatory goodwill amortization is so problematic - it's based on the false premise that goodwill consistently declines in value. The reality is that goodwill, like land, needs to be evaluated based on its economic characteristics and performance, not through arbitrary accounting conventions. Unfortunately, what we're seeing is that to avoid dealing with these artificial goodwill charges, many managers have resorted to embracing another fiction - the pooling method. Neither approach really captures the economic reality of what goodwill represents."

But that's not how things work in the real world. In reality, when there's a merger, there's almost always clearly an acquirer and an acquiree. If you want proof of this, just walk down to the company and ask any employee who's lost their job which company was the conqueror and which was conquered. They'll tell you right quick - there's never any confusion about that. The reason managers like pooling is simple: it lets them avoid recording goodwill and the subsequent charges to earnings that come with it. By pretending it's not really a purchase - even when they've paid a big 'sell-out' premium - they can make their accounting look better than it really is. But we shouldn't be running from one accounting fiction just to embrace another. The truth is, in most mergers, a purchase has definitely been made, and our accounting should reflect that reality.

This would create a large asset representing economic goodwill in most cases.

It's a practical solution that reflects the economic reality of what's actually happening in these transactions. The key is to stop playing accounting games and instead focus on recording these transactions in a way that matches their true economic substance. If we run businesses right, as we've done at Berkshire, this kind of growth can continue for decades - we're looking at least another 78 years by my calculations.

Now, if that economic goodwill becomes impaired later on, which sometimes happens, you'd write it down just like you would with any other impaired asset. The beauty of this approach is that it would make acquisition accounting consistent across America, which is far from what we have today. And I'll tell you something else - if we implemented this system, you'd see managements making acquisition decisions based on what actually matters for their shareholders rather than trying to manipulate reported earnings. They'd choose between cash and stock based on real economic consequences, not accounting fiction. That's the kind of clarity and economic reality we need in our accounting systems."

In our case at Jordan's, we deliberately chose to purchase assets for cash because it allows us to amortize the goodwill over 15 years on our tax returns. This approach significantly increases the actual cash flow the business generates for our shareholders, even though it reduces reported earnings. Now, contrast this with buying stock for cash - in that scenario, the goodwill writeoffs aren't tax-deductible at all. But I'll tell you what's absolutely the worst deal from an economic standpoint: it's a stock-for-stock acquisition. In these deals, companies often pay an enormous price but get no step-up in the tax basis - not for the acquiree's stock, not for their assets, nothing. So you're paying a premium but getting no tax benefit whatsoever. The key is to focus on what maximizes cash production for shareholders, not what makes the accounting statements look prettier."

The main problem is that you're often paying a huge price without getting any step-up in the tax basis - neither for the stock of the company you're buying nor its assets. Here's where it gets really painful: if you later want to sell that acquired entity, you might end up owing a massive capital gains tax at 35% or higher, even in situations where you're actually experiencing a real economic loss. Now, at Berkshire, we've done some deals that weren't perfectly optimal from a tax structure standpoint, but we only did those because the sellers insisted on specific structures and we still saw enough value to make the deals worthwhile overall. But I want to be very clear about one thing - we've never structured a deal inefficiently just to make our figures look prettier. That's not how we operate."

Let me explain why this matters. When we own a significant portion of a business, there are earnings attributable to our ownership that go well beyond just the dividends we receive. In fact, we actually prefer that our investees retain most of their earnings rather than pay them out as dividends. The reason is straightforward - these companies often have opportunities to reinvest those earnings at high rates of return. That's why we developed what we call 'look-through' earnings. This measure combines three things: first, our operating earnings; second, our share of the retained operating earnings from our major investees that don't show up in GAAP accounting; and third, we subtract an allowance for the taxes we'd have to pay if those retained earnings were distributed to us. This gives us a much clearer picture of the economic reality at Berkshire than what you see in the reported earnings alone."

This second view aligns with how Charlie and I actually analyze and manage the company. It's important to us that our shareholders understand both the official accounting perspective and our management perspective. We believe this dual approach gives our investors a more complete picture of what's really happening at Berkshire. The GAAP numbers are necessary, of course, but the four-segment breakdown helps tell the real story of how we view our operations."

Because we have no special insights into which tech companies have truly durable competitive advantages. And you know what? That doesn't bother us one bit. Look, there are many areas where we bring nothing to the table - whether it's evaluating patents, manufacturing processes, or geological prospects. We just don't make judgments in those fields. If others claim they can predict the long-term economics of fast-changing industries and seem to be validated by the stock market, that's fine - we neither envy nor emulate them. Our real strength, if we have one, is knowing exactly where our circle of competence ends. We're very good at recognizing when we're operating within it and when we're approaching its edges.

When we do find these situations, they can make for excellent long-term investment results.

This is why we make relatively few portfolio changes - when we find companies with genuine competitive advantages that we understand, we tend to stick with them through temporary setbacks.

When we look at the broader market, equity investors seem to have wildly optimistic expectations about future returns. Here's how we think about it: Corporate profit growth is fundamentally tied to the business activity in the country - that is, GDP. And we see GDP growing at a real rate of about 3%. That's the reality we're working with. So when market valuations seem to be pricing in expectations well above what these fundamental factors would support, we have to be cautious. These reservations about prices apply both to the securities we own and to the general level of equity prices.

Add in the market's expected inflation of about 2% - and you can verify that expectation by looking at the spread between TIPS and standard Treasury bonds - and you're looking at nominal growth of around 5%. Now, if corporate profits grow along with GDP at that 5% rate, it's pretty unlikely that the valuation multiples placed on American business will expand much beyond that. Even when you factor in dividends, you're still looking at returns that are dramatically lower than what most investors have experienced historically or what they're expecting going forward. I've been around long enough to know that when investor expectations eventually become more realistic - and they always do - the market adjustment tends to be severe. This is particularly true in those areas where speculation has been most concentrated. It's just simple mathematics - you can't expect extraordinary returns when the underlying business growth is ordinary."

In fact, when people start trying to explain what's happening in the truly-manic portions of this 'enchanted' market, I'm reminded of another line of song: 'Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.' We maintain our discipline and wait for the right opportunities. The market will do what it does, and when it offers us chances to invest significant capital at reasonable prices, we'll be ready.

And when I say available funds, I'm talking about both cash on hand and sensible borrowing capacity. Not just one or the other. Second, the stock must be selling below its intrinsic value, and I mean conservatively calculated intrinsic value. But there's also an important caveat here that I want to emphasize: shareholders need to have all the information required to estimate that value themselves. We've occasionally seen situations where insiders took advantage of uninformed partners by buying out their interests at far below true worth.

That's not optional; it's essential to stay competitive in retail. The second category involves optional expenditures that are aimed at business growth, but - and this is crucial - only when management has a reasonable expectation that each dollar spent will create more than a dollar in value. A good example of this is when R.C. Willey expanded into Idaho. Only after these two types of needs are fully funded should we even begin to think about share repurchases. And even then, a company with growth-oriented shareholders might be better served by buying new businesses rather than repurchasing shares.

In fact, during that period, Charlie and I specifically looked for companies doing large repurchases because it often signaled two things: the company was undervalued and it had shareholder-oriented management. But here's the problem today - repurchases have become fashionable for all the wrong reasons. Many companies are now buying back shares simply to pump or support their stock price. While this might benefit shareholders who are selling today, it's terrible for continuing shareholders when companies pay more than intrinsic value. As I like to say, buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business for those who stick around.

The decision to repurchase shares should stand entirely on its own merits. Charlie and I are quite careful about this - we only feel confident estimating intrinsic value for a portion of traded equities, and even then, we use a range of values rather than trying to be pseudo-precise.

Think about that for a moment - they're issuing options at low prices and then buying back stock at higher prices. The fundamental problem here is the flawed logic. Both option grants and repurchases may make sense individually, but they're not logically related activities. Just because stock has been issued to satisfy options - or for any other reason - doesn't mean that stock should be repurchased at a price above intrinsic value. The reverse is also true: if a stock is well below intrinsic value, it should be repurchased whether or not stock has previously been issued or may be needed for outstanding options.

That's not correct thinking. The only thing that matters is the relationship between the current market price and intrinsic value. I'll be the first to admit that I've made mistakes in this area. There were times when I was too conservative in my value estimates or got too excited about other opportunities, and we missed some chances to repurchase shares. But here's something important to understand - even when we miss these opportunities, the trading volume was usually too light for us to have done much buying anyway. To put some numbers on it, if you can repurchase 2% of a company's shares at a 25% discount to intrinsic value, you're only creating a half-percent gain in per-share value at most.
