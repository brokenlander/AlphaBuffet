Looking at our own history at Berkshire, we're a perfect example of why this distinction matters. When we started in 1964, we were a struggling textile business where the book value actually overstated what the company was really worth. But over the next 40 years, we transformed Berkshire into a diversified enterprise worth far more than what shows up in the accounting books. While we've achieved a 21.9% compounded annual growth in book value, which took us from $19 to $55,824 per share, our gain in intrinsic value has actually been even better than that. Now, we still use book value calculations at Berkshire as a useful gauge - think of it as a slightly understated yardstick for measuring our long-term growth in intrinsic value. But the key thing to remember is that intrinsic value is what really counts. That's why Charlie and I focus on building intrinsic value, which reflects the true economic value we're creating for shareholders."

In the 1980s, our equity holdings, including convertible preferreds, represented about 114% of our net worth on average. But in recent years, that percentage has dropped to less than 50%. This fundamental change means that market movements affect a much smaller portion of our net worth than they used to. The practical effect is pretty straightforward - we'll tend to underperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform when they fall. It's simply a mathematical reality based on our current structure. That's why our yearly performance comparisons against the S&P 500 aren't as relevant as they once were. We've become a more diversified enterprise, and while our book value continues to be a useful measure for tracking our long-term increase in intrinsic value, these year-to-year comparisons with the stock market index don't tell the whole story anymore. This is just another example of why it's important for our shareholders to understand how our business has evolved over time."

Our equity holdings have come down quite substantially as a percentage of our net worth - we're now below 50% compared to averaging about 114% back in the 1980s. What this means in practical terms is that when the stock market makes big moves up or down, it affects a much smaller portion of our net worth than it used to. So in years when stocks rise substantially, we'll likely underperform the market, and in years when stocks fall, we'll tend to overperform. But here's the key thing to understand - and I want to be very clear about this: What really matters isn't how we do in any given year, but how we perform against the S&P over the long term. That's our measuring stick. Our shareholders can easily buy an index fund at very low cost, so unless Charlie and I can deliver gains in per-share intrinsic value that beat the S&P over time, we're not really adding value beyond what you could do yourself. That's the standard we hold ourselves to, and that's what we focus on."

And I'm pleased to say that's exactly what they do. They take care of their businesses first, and then send any excess cash to us in Omaha for deployment. Now, speaking of deployment, I have to be frank - I didn't do a very good job with that last year. What I really wanted to do was make several multi-billion dollar acquisitions that would add new and significant earnings streams to complement what we already have. But I struck out on that front. To make matters worse, I found very few attractive securities to buy in the market. The end result? We wound up sitting on $43 billion in cash equivalents, which is not a position I'm happy about. But I want to be clear - our lackluster performance wasn't due to any stumbles by our operating CEOs. As always, they more than pulled their weight. The shortfall was on my end in terms of capital allocation, and I'm direct about acknowledging that."

It should have been simple for investors to get good returns - all they needed to do was piggyback on Corporate America in a diversified, low-expense way. An index fund they never touched would have done the job. But instead, many investors got themselves into trouble in three main ways. First, they racked up high costs, usually from excessive trading or spending too much on investment management. Second, they made portfolio decisions based on tips and fads instead of doing thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses. And third - this is particularly troublesome - they used a start-and-stop approach to the market, jumping in after advances were well underway and running away after periods of stagnation or decline. It's like they were trying to time the market instead of staying the course.

If you look at the 35 years since the 1960s ended, the S&P's average annual return, including dividends, was 11.2%. Now, you might think we'd see quite a few years with returns close to that average - say, between 8% and 14%. But here's the remarkable thing: in all those 35 years, 2004 was only the second year that fell into that 'normal' range. It's a perfect example of how averages can be misleading in the stock market. The 11.2% average return wasn't achieved by most years clustering around that number - instead, we saw much more volatility, with returns typically falling well above or below that range. This is why I've always said that investors need to be prepared for volatility and not expect smooth, predictable returns. The market doesn't work that way, and 2004's 'normal' return was actually quite abnormal in historical context."

Too many investors are trading excessively and paying far too much for investment management. It's like throwing money out the window, and believe me, those costs compound over time to create real damage. Second, I see too many people making investment decisions based on tips and fads rather than doing what they should be doing - conducting thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses. That's not investing; that's speculating. The third problem is what I call the start-and-stop approach, where investors jump in after the market has already had a long advance and bail out after periods of decline or stagnation. This is exactly backwards. The key principle here is really quite simple: excitement and expenses are your enemies in investing. If you're going to try to time the market - which I don't recommend - at least try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. That's the opposite of what most investors do, and it's why they get such poor results."

Here's the issue - we have businesses with vastly different economic characteristics. When you throw all these numbers together in consolidated statements, you end up with what I call a 'jumble of figures' that makes useful analysis almost impossible. That's why we break things down into major categories and provide specific commentary about each. We're particularly careful to explain our approach to debt, which we typically avoid. But here's what's equally important - we won't overwhelm our shareholders with data that doesn't help them estimate Berkshire's intrinsic value. There's no point in providing information just for information's sake.

Let me explain it this way: If you're dealing with just one key variable that has a 90% chance of success, your overall probability is clear - it's 90%. But here's where it gets interesting - when you start adding more variables, even if each one has that same 90% probability, your chances of overall success drop dramatically. With ten independent variables, you're down to just 35% likelihood of success. That's exactly what happened with our zinc project. We kept solving problem after problem, and each time we thought we were close, another issue would pop up - it was like a game of whack-a-mole. In mining and oil exploration, prospects have this way of teasing their developers. We eventually solved most problems, but that one remaining issue proved intractable. And that's all it took to sink the project. It's why I always say look for what I call - and pardon the oxymoron - mono-linked chains.

That's not just a casual decision; it's fundamental to our strategy. We've built this network to include more than 18,000 brokers, and what makes me particularly optimistic is that we're almost certain to grow substantially in the next decade. Our approach is straightforward - we look for leading localized operations to acquire. You see, real estate is inherently a local business, and maintaining those local identities and connections is crucial. We're not trying to create some monolithic national brand that loses touch with local markets. Instead, we're building strength through a network of strong local operators who know their markets inside and out. This model has proven itself time and again, and it's why I'm confident about our continued expansion in this sector."

When you pay your insurance premium to us, you're paying upfront for a service - insurance protection - that we'll deliver over the next year or so. That creates float. We also get float when there's a delay between when losses occur and when we actually pay claims - think about asbestos cases, which can take many years to settle. When we bought National Indemnity in 1967, we had $20 million in float. Today, that's grown to $46.1 billion, both through internal growth and acquisitions. Now, here's why float is so wonderful for us - it's been like a fountain of funds that we've used to acquire securities and businesses that give us an ever-widening variety of earnings streams. But there's a key point I want to emphasize: float is only wonderful if it doesn't come at a high price. That price is determined by our underwriting results - basically, whether we make or lose money on our insurance operations. In about half of our 38 years in insurance, we've actually made an underwriting profit, which means we got paid to hold other people's money. That's quite different from most insurers, who typically operate at an underwriting loss."

That means they're losing money on their actual insurance operations. But at Berkshire, we've achieved an underwriting profit in about half of the 38 years we've been in the insurance business. This is crucial because it affects the cost of our float. When we achieve an underwriting profit, our float is actually better than free - we're literally being paid to hold other people's money. Think about that for a moment. While other insurers are paying to borrow float, we're often getting paid to hold it. This has been one of our key competitive advantages since we purchased NICO in 1967. We've turned insurance from a traditionally money-losing operation into a profitable one, while simultaneously using the float to fuel our growth through investments and acquisitions. It's this combination - disciplined underwriting plus intelligent use of float - that has made insurance the core business and primary growth propellant of Berkshire over the years."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Well, the fundamental problem is really quite simple - insurance is essentially a commodity product. Let me explain why that's so important. When you're selling a commodity, you're selling something that's basically identical no matter who's providing it. The policy forms are standardized, and customers generally don't have any particular loyalty to one insurance provider over another. You see, nobody wakes up in the morning saying 'I must have a National Indemnity policy!' the way they might specifically ask for Gillette blades or a Coca-Cola. Think about it like airline seats - they're pretty much the same whether you're flying one carrier or another. This leads to fierce price competition, which drives down profitability. Adding to this challenge is the fact that you've got many suppliers in the market, including mutual companies that are owned by policyholders rather than stockholders, so they don't even need to generate large profits. The end result is that the property-casualty industry almost invariably operates at an underwriting loss. When that loss gets too large, the cost of float - that's the money we hold from premiums before paying claims - can become devastatingly expensive. That's the fundamental economics that make this such a difficult business for most insurers."

But here's what's fascinating - despite lacking all these supposedly crucial advantages, NICO has been a star performer for almost all of the past 38 years. This really demonstrates something I've always believed about business - that success doesn't always come from the most obvious places or follow conventional wisdom. We've had to attack the industry's problems in several ways to achieve some measure of enduring competitive advantage. The key has been finding our own path rather than trying to compete head-on in the traditional ways that make insurance such a difficult business for most companies. Sometimes the best opportunities come from places where others see nothing special at all."

But here's the key - we never left our customers; they left us because we refused to match foolishly low prices. The business was there for the taking - we could have written billions in premiums. But we consistently priced to make a profit, not to match our most optimistic competitor. You see, in insurance, there's this dangerous tendency toward self-deception. You can write poorly-priced policies today, and it might take years before the true loss costs become apparent. That's what nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970s. Most businesses have what I call an 'institutional imperative' that makes them reject extended decreases in volume. What CEO wants to report declining business year after year? But at NICO, we maintained our discipline, and that decision has been crucial to Berkshire's success. In fact, without this acquisition and this approach, Berkshire would likely be worth half of what it is today."

Look at our track record - for almost 38 years, NICO has been a star performer, not because we had some structural advantage, but because we had the mental fortitude to do what others wouldn't. We were willing to watch our premium volume drop dramatically over many years while maintaining our pricing discipline. This mindset - the ability to resist the institutional imperative to maintain or grow volume at the expense of profitability - turned out to be more valuable than any traditional competitive advantage. It's a simple principle, but it's incredibly difficult for most organizations to execute consistently."

When we look at insurance results, we're dealing with two major uncertainties. First, many claims come in after the year ends - what we call IBNR, or incurred but not reported claims. We have to estimate not just how many will come in, but what they'll cost us. Second, and this is crucial, claims can take years or even decades to settle. The further back you go, like our results through 1999, we're pretty confident about those numbers because those years are what we call 'mature' - almost all claims are settled. But when you look at recent years, like 2003 and 2004 in this case, we're doing a lot more guesswork. It's like trying to predict the final score of a baseball game in the third inning - you might have some indicators, but there's still a lot of game left to play.

As I like to say, this is not Donald Trump's sort of place. Now, we can do this because NICO isn't labor-intensive, and we can handle having some excess overhead. But what we absolutely cannot live with is underpriced business and the breakdown in underwriting discipline that comes with it. That's a path to destruction in insurance.

It's about having real fortitude embedded in your company's culture. At NICO, we've had four CEOs since 1940, and none of them have bent on this principle - interestingly enough, only one of them was a college graduate.

But Tom taught me to view it as a $3 million decision. Why? Because when you factor in the lifetime cost of an employee - the raises, the benefits, the additional overhead (as Tom would say, 'more people, more toilet paper') - you're looking at a much bigger number than just that initial salary. And here's another critical point - if you have a no-layoff policy like we believe in, you need to be especially careful about overstaffing during good times. Because unless the company hits really hard times, that employee is likely to stay on the payroll for years, even if their contribution becomes marginal. This is why staffing decisions need to be evaluated not just for their immediate impact, but for their long-term implications on the business."

That's why Charlie and I applaud when Don's volume goes down in soft markets. Now, GEICO is a completely different animal. As a low-cost operator in auto insurance, GEICO must maintain what I call a foot-to-the-floor strategy. When you have a structural cost advantage in a commodity business, you need to press that advantage consistently and aggressively. You can't ebb and flow - you have to keep pushing.

It's not something you necessarily get from formal education. Look at Don's performance - he's accumulated $950 million in float that's likely to be negative-cost over time.

So while education can certainly be valuable, our experience at NICO demonstrates that exceptional business ability is more about natural talent than academic credentials. It's about having that inherent understanding of business principles and the discipline to stick to them."

You see, he recognized that auto insurance was both mandatory and a fairly standardized product. Unlike business insurance, where you might need professional advice to figure out complex coverage needs, most car owners already knew what basic auto policy they needed. So Goodwin's genius was in seeing that you could eliminate what he viewed as an unnecessary and expensive link in the distribution chain. By going direct to consumers - first through mail to government employees, and later through phone and advertising - GEICO could dramatically lower costs. And that's exactly what he did, starting with just $200,000 in 1936. It's a classic example of how rethinking traditional business models can create tremendous competitive advantages. When someone figures out how to remove costly middlemen from a mandatory product, that's the kind of business insight that creates lasting value."

You see, before State Farm came along in 1922, the industry giants were competing for independent agents, which led to high commissions and, ultimately, high prices for consumers. But George Mecherle, a farmer from Illinois, saw an opportunity in this high-cost environment. By creating a 'captive' agency system - meaning agents who could only sell State Farm products - they kept acquisition costs much lower than competitors who used independent agents playing companies against each other. The results were remarkable. State Farm grew to capture about 25% of the personal lines market, completely outpacing those old industry giants. Allstate followed the same playbook starting in 1931 and became number two in personal lines. It's a perfect example of how capitalism works its magic - when you build a more efficient system that delivers better value to customers, you can transform an entire industry. Both companies proved that a lower-cost structure, even in a traditional agency model, could create sustainable competitive advantages."

Take personal-lines insurance and workers' compensation - about 60% of the property-casualty industry's volume has state-mandated protections where solvent companies help pay for the failures of others. Now, I'm not saying we like subsidizing poor management, but that's the system we work with. But when you move into reinsurance, you're in a whole different ballgame. When a reinsurer fails, it creates what I'd call a cascade effect - staggering losses hit all the primary companies they've dealt with. I've seen this firsthand at GEICO, where we lost tens of millions due to some careless reinsurer selections back in the early 1980s. This isn't just theoretical - it's a real risk that keeps insurance executives up at night. And if we were to see a true mega-catastrophe, something bigger than even the World Trade Center disaster that cost the industry $35 billion, some reinsurers simply wouldn't make it through. That's why we're extremely careful about our reinsurance partnerships at Berkshire."

Both of these events sent major shockwaves through the insurance and reinsurance world. But here's what keeps me watchful - these events, as devastating as they were, might not represent the upper limit of what could happen. I believe there's a real possibility of a true mega-catastrophe occurring in the next decade or two that could dwarf these previous losses. The concerning part is that such an event would likely cause some reinsurers to fail entirely. This isn't just idle speculation - we've seen how even smaller catastrophes can rock the industry. When you consider that many primary insurers depend heavily on their reinsurance protection, you start to understand the potential domino effect. That's why at Berkshire, we maintain extraordinary financial strength and why we're so selective about the risks we take on. We want to be there to pay claims even after the most extreme events."

You see, when you're dealing with contracts that might not settle for decades and involve multiple variables, putting a precise market price on them becomes quite tricky. What really concerns me is how these marks affect annual bonuses for managers and traders. When your compensation depends on these marks, there's a natural tendency to record what I call phantom profits. It's like grading your own homework. The marks might look good on paper, but they don't necessarily reflect economic reality. This is particularly dangerous because these derivative positions can run for very long periods - sometimes decades. You're essentially making assumptions about events far into the future, and those assumptions can be manipulated to show profits that may never materialize. That's why I've always been skeptical of complex derivative operations and their marking practices."

This is particularly relevant when we look at situations like what happened in the manufactured home industry.

But when the tide went out - when the market normalized - we saw sales drop to just 40% of what they were during those peak years.

Last year we had $1.15 trillion of such legitimate trade, and that's wonderful.

This imbalance is weighing down the dollar, and its decline has already been substantial. I expect this decline to continue without policy changes. What concerns me is that currency markets could become disorderly and create spillover effects, both political and financial.

But here's where it gets problematic - what I call pseudo-trade is when we buy goods and services that aren't matched by reciprocal purchases. Last year, we had $618 billion of this unreciprocated purchasing. The key difference is that true trade creates mutual benefits, while this pseudo-trade results in a one-way transfer of wealth from the U.S. to the rest of the world. In economics, there's always an offset - that's just how it works. So when we engage in this unbalanced trade, we're not just buying goods, we're actually transferring wealth out of our country.

Either we're giving them IOUs - think government or private debt - or we're letting them buy up our assets directly, like stocks and real estate. The end result is the same: Americans end up owning less of America, while foreigners own more. To put this in perspective, foreign countries and their citizens now own a net of about $3 trillion of the U.S. That's a staggering figure, especially when you consider that just a decade ago, their net ownership was negligible.

If we're just talking about budget deficits in isolation, 100% of our country's output still belongs to our citizens. Think of it this way: We're like a rich family with plenty of goods. The budget deficit is really just an internal family discussion, carried out through our legislators, about how to distribute what we have - who pays taxes and who receives government benefits.

It's similar to how a family that's deep in debt has to dedicate more and more of its income to paying off the finance company rather than improving its own standard of living.

Instead, we're trading wealth for product to the tune of $0.6 trillion annually. This is a completely different dynamic than what Smith was advocating. It's like comparing apples and oranges, and then trying to use the rules for apple trading to justify orange trading.

We're able to do this because we have a vast store of assets and a pristine credit history. The world lets us use what amounts to a credit card denominated in our own currency, something they wouldn't allow any other nation to do. Now, foreign investors aren't too worried yet - they see us as spending junkies, but they know we're rich junkies. But here's the reality: this spendthrift behavior won't be tolerated indefinitely. While we can't predict exactly when or how this trade problem will come to a head, I can tell you it's unlikely to end in a way that strengthens our currency relative to our trading partners."

I'd be criticizing that policy too. But what's happening now is that the rest of the world is effectively practicing mercantilism against the United States, whether they intend to or not. They're able to do this because of our unique position - we have substantial assets and that sterling credit history I mentioned. Think about it: no other country could get away with what we're doing, running such massive deficits using their own currency. It's a dangerous game we're playing. That's why I believe we need to adopt policies that will quickly and substantially reduce the current-account deficit. The longer we wait, the more difficult the eventual adjustment will be."

For anyone wanting to stay informed about these matters, I strongly recommend The Financial Times.

We also have to record losses each year for premiums that exceed the increase in CSV. In 2004, for example, we recorded $207 million in net 'losses' from these purchases and premium payments. But here's the key point - these are just bookkeeping charges, not real economic losses. If we thought they were real losses, we certainly wouldn't be buying these policies. It's similar to buying a bond at a premium - you might pay more than par value, but you know you'll get your return over time. When we eventually receive the proceeds from these policies, we'll record the excess over CSV as realized investment gains. So while the accounting treatment might look peculiar in the short term, we're focused on the long-term economic reality of these investments."

The second reform is what we call the 'whistleblower line.' This is a way for employees to communicate directly with me and the audit committee without fear of retaliation. It's a simple concept but powerful in practice. Both of these reforms are about creating more transparency and accountability in our corporate governance structure.

Now, I'll be honest - most of what we receive is fairly trivial, what I'd call the 'guy next to me has bad breath' variety of complaints. But occasionally, we learn about significant issues at our subsidiaries that we would have completely missed otherwise. What's particularly interesting is that these aren't typically things that would show up in an audit - they're usually related to personnel matters or business practices. Looking back, I can say with certainty that Berkshire would be more valuable today if I had implemented a whistleblower line decades ago. There's really no downside to having this system in place, and the potential benefits are substantial. It's a perfect example of how good governance can create real value in a large, decentralized organization."

And third, are proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value? These are the essential issues that directly impact shareholder value. The challenge here is that on these crucial questions, the CEO's interests often diverge from those of the shareholders. And unfortunately, we frequently see directors who either lack the knowledge or the courage to stand up to the CEO on these matters. The institutional investors, who should be leading the way in addressing these fundamental issues, have instead been less than awe-inspiring in their approach.

When some institutions claimed I wasn't independent because McLane and Dairy Queen buy lots of Coke products, they missed the fundamental economic reality. Think about it - how could our Coke purchases possibly control my decision-making when Berkshire holds $8 billion worth of Coke stock? It's simple arithmetic. My loyalty naturally lies with the owners of Coke, not its management, because that's where our economic interests are aligned. Too often, these institutions just follow a checklist approach to governance issues instead of thinking through the actual economic relationships and incentives at play. True independence isn't about checking boxes - it's about having the ability and motivation to act in shareholders' best interests."

What we often see instead is shareholders simply following a 'checklist' approach to whatever the issue of the day might be. This can lead to misguided decisions and ineffective governance. The key is understanding the real economic relationships and incentives at play. Take my situation at Coca-Cola - instead of looking at the underlying economic reality of Berkshire's massive ownership stake, some institutions got caught up in superficial independence criteria. Large owners need to think independently and focus on substantive issues that actually affect shareholder value, not just follow the crowd on the latest governance trends. When big shareholders don't fulfill this role, you end up with less effective oversight of management."

Now, this goes back to a fundamental principle that Jesus actually explained better than any governance expert I've seen - 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.' It's simple arithmetic. When board members have significant personal wealth tied to the company's performance, their interests naturally align with shareholders. We also avoid the common practice of paying large board fees that could compromise independence. Our directors receive minimal fees compared to their annual income, and we don't even carry liability insurance for them. They're walking the same path as our shareholders, taking the same risks. I've seen too many cases where directors who depend heavily on board fees for their income end up being the least independent. It's human nature - if a significant portion of your income comes from board fees, and you're hoping to get recommended for other boards, well, that's going to influence your behavior, whether you admit it or not."

The math is crystal clear on this. My heart and mind belong to the owners of Coke because that's where our treasure is - all $8 billion of it. This goes back to what Charlie and I have observed over many years in boardrooms: true independence comes from having your economic interests aligned with shareholders. The idea that I would compromise the value of our massive Coke investment for the sake of some routine transactions just doesn't make any sense.

And many of them hope to be appointed to other boards to increase that income further. Now, don't get me wrong - most of these directors are decent people doing good work. But we have to be realistic about human nature. When someone's livelihood depends significantly on those board fees, they're naturally going to be hesitant about taking actions that might threaten that income stream. It's like what the Bible says about where your treasure is - that's where your heart will be too. True independence, in my view, comes from having no financial dependence on the board position. That's why Charlie and I always look at the economic incentives at play.

But here's where it gets interesting: A group of directors, each making about $100,000 annually in board and committee fees, effectively killed the proposal. The shareholders never even got to hear about this offer. Now, what's particularly telling is that these directors owned very little stock themselves, except for what the company had given them. They hadn't been buying shares in the open market, even when the stock was trading well below the proposed acquisition price. This is a perfect example of how directors who are supposedly independent might act in ways that prevent shareholders from making their own decisions about their investments. The economic incentives of protecting their board positions appeared to outweigh their willingness to let shareholders evaluate a potentially beneficial transaction.

These directors were supposedly independent, but they were facing a situation where approving a deal would effectively end their director fees. What's particularly telling is that these same directors hadn't been willing to buy the company's stock with their own money at prices well below the acquisition offer, yet they were making decisions about whether shareholders should be able to receive that higher price. Then, at the very same meeting where they rejected the deal, they voted to increase their own fees. You see, self-interest has a way of clouding judgment - even one's own understanding of their motivations. That's why I always look at what people do with their own money, not just what they say or how they vote with others' money.
