Let me put this in perspective - Katrina alone cost us $2.5 billion, and Rita and Wilma added another $0.9 billion to our insurance losses. These were record-setting losses for both Berkshire and the industry. But here's the key thing - our insurance business still performed well overall, and I'll tell you why. GEICO, under Tony Nicely's leadership, achieved remarkable results that helped offset these catastrophic losses. They improved productivity by 32% in just two years, reduced employment by 4% while growing their policy count by 26%. When you can drive down unit costs like that, you create value for customers and shareholders alike. GEICO gained market share and earned good profits despite the hurricane losses. So while natural disasters can certainly impact our results significantly, having well-run operations like GEICO helps provide stability even in challenging years."

Think of it this way - I want shareholders to have the information they need to make their own estimates of Berkshire's intrinsic value. That's actually one of my main goals in writing these annual letters. But I also want them to understand that this isn't an exact science. You can do all the math correctly and still end up with a number that's far from reality if your assumptions about the future turn out to be incorrect. That's why we focus so much on businesses we can understand and try to maintain a margin of safety in our calculations. It's about being approximately right rather than precisely wrong."

On one hand, Berkshire has some clear advantages in calculating intrinsic value - we have relatively stable earnings streams, great liquidity, and minimum debt. These characteristics actually make our intrinsic value more precisely calculable than most companies. But here's the challenge: back in 1965, we just had a small textile operation, and calculating intrinsic value was, as I like to say, a snap. Today, we're looking at 68 distinct businesses, each with their own operating and financial characteristics, plus our massive investment holdings. It's like going from solving a simple addition problem to tackling a complex algebra equation with dozens of variables. You can't just look at our consolidated financial statements and come up with an informed estimate anymore. That's why we've tried to help by grouping our businesses into four logical clusters. But even then, you have to consider whether these businesses perform better or worse as part of our larger enterprise, and how our capital allocation decisions as a holding company affect the overall value. So while our financial stability makes the math more reliable, the sheer complexity of our organization makes the calculation far more challenging."

Think of it this way: the more uncertain a business's future is, the more likely your calculation will be wildly off-base. It's like trying to predict the weather - the further out you go, the less reliable your forecast becomes. That's why we at Berkshire prefer businesses with relatively stable earnings streams. We've deliberately structured ourselves with great liquidity and minimum debt, which helps reduce some of this uncertainty. But even with these advantages, we have to remain humble about our ability to precisely calculate intrinsic value. You can do all the math perfectly, use all the right formulas, but if the underlying business has significant uncertainty about its future, your calculation could end up being way off the mark. That's why we need to build in a margin of safety and why we're always very careful to say we're making estimates rather than precise calculations."

You might see some breathtaking growth rates that look wonderful on paper but are really just mathematical illusions. Now, in our case with the 1965-2005 figures I showed you, we actually used a base year that was abnormally good - 1965 was a stellar year for us, better than all but one of the previous ten years. So when we show our 17.2% compound growth rate over that period, we're actually understating rather than overstating our growth. That's the kind of transparency we believe in at Berkshire. The numbers need to tell the true story, not just a good story.

The growth rates between these two elements have changed notably in the last decade because of this strategic shift. But I want to be clear about something - both Charlie and I aren't satisfied with just one type of growth. We want to keep pushing those numbers up in both categories. That's why we continue to look for opportunities in both areas - good businesses we can buy entirely and good stocks we can buy through our insurance operations. It's like having two engines powering an airplane - we want both of them running at full capacity. Our compound growth rate of 30.2% in non-insurance earnings from 1995-2005 shows how this acquisition strategy has worked for us, but we're always looking for ways to grow both sides of our operation."

I've been guilty of this myself in the past, and I'll be direct with you - those stock-based deals I made ended up costing our shareholders money. That's why at Berkshire, we're very particular about this. Look at 2005 - we agreed to five acquisitions, and I'm pleased to tell you that none of them involved issuing Berkshire shares. We believe in paying cash for our purchases. It's cleaner, more straightforward, and most importantly, it doesn't dilute our existing shareholders' ownership.

We expect our existing operations to deliver modest growth in operating earnings, but that's not enough for what we consider truly satisfactory gains. That's why major acquisitions are so critical to our future success. I'll give you an example of how we're approaching this - in 2005, we made real progress by agreeing to five purchases, including MedPro, a medical malpractice insurer with a 106-year history. We're constantly looking at both elements of value growth at Berkshire, much like that couple on their 50th anniversary - though unlike that gentleman who had to choose between dinner and romance, we're working to improve both our existing operations and our acquisition strategy.

Think of it like this: when you pay your insurance premium upfront, we're holding onto that money even though we haven't yet provided all the insurance protection you've paid for. We also get float from claims that take time to settle. You see, when an accident happens today, we might not pay out the claim for years, especially with complex cases like asbestos claims. What makes float so wonderful - and I really mean wonderful - is when we get it at a good price or even better, for free. The cost comes down to our underwriting results - basically whether we take in more in premiums than we pay out in expenses and losses. In about half of our 39 years in insurance, we've actually made an underwriting profit, which means we got paid to hold other people's money. That's a beautiful thing. We started with just $20 million in float back in 1967, and now we're up to $49 billion. But here's the key - float is only valuable if you don't pay too much for it. Most insurance companies actually operate at an underwriting loss, which means they're paying to hold float. We've been fortunate to do better than that about half the time."

But what's crucial to understand is that we're very disciplined about our acquisition approach. We don't just buy businesses because they're for sale - they need to fit our careful criteria and the price needs to make sense. And you know what? I'm always ready to hear about businesses that fit our requirements. As I like to say, like a hopeful teenage girl, I'll be waiting by the phone. That's not just a cute line - I mean it.

Then suddenly in 2004-2005, we saw seven major storms in just two years, including Katrina, which was the most destructive in industry history. Now, Joe Brandon, Ajit Jain, and I don't know for certain if this is just an anomaly or if it represents a fundamental change in hurricane patterns due to climate or ocean temperature changes. But like Pascal, we have to make decisions despite our ignorance. When you don't know the answer but the consequences could be severe, you have to price for that uncertainty. That's why we've decided to write mega-catastrophe policies only at prices significantly higher than last year's levels. And we're being very careful about our aggregate exposure - we won't take on risk levels that could cause us distress if these storm patterns continue or worsen. In insurance, like in investing, you don't have to know exactly what will happen, but you do need to protect yourself against what could happen."

Let me lay it out clearly: For a full century before 2004, we saw about 59 hurricanes of Category 3 strength or greater hit the Southeastern and Gulf Coast states. Only three of these were Category 5 storms. That's our baseline. But then look at what happened in just two years: 2004 brought three Category 3 storms to these areas, and 2005 brought four more, including Katrina. Even more concerning, in 2005 alone we had three Category 5 storms that fortunately weakened before landfall - that's as many Category 5s in one year as we had in the previous hundred years. The recent experience is definitely worrisome. Now, we have to be careful about drawing absolute conclusions here. We don't know with certainty whether this represents a permanent shift due to atmospheric or oceanic changes, or if it's just an unusual cluster of events. But when you see patterns this dramatic, you have to at least consider the possibility that something fundamental has changed. That's why we're adjusting our approach to writing these policies - we need to account for the possibility that these aren't just random events but could represent a new normal with potentially devastating consequences."

Now, the original rationale in 1990 was to meet insurance clients' needs, but I challenge anyone to explain what legitimate insurance need requires a century-long derivative contract. The reality is these long-dated contracts were likely more about trader compensation than client needs.

This was particularly interesting because Oakwood had been one of the largest companies in the business just a few years earlier. Then in 2005, we added Karsten's four-plant operation, which gave us a much stronger presence on the West Coast. This kind of expansion - buying good assets at reasonable prices and integrating them into our existing operations - is exactly how we like to grow. We're not interested in growth just for growth's sake, but when we see opportunities to strengthen our position in markets we understand, particularly when we can buy good assets at good prices like in a bankruptcy situation, we're ready to move decisively."

When you have a contract with multiple variables and a settlement date far in the future, you're essentially giving traders and firms a license to use their imagination in valuing these instruments. I've seen this firsthand - two different firms can look at the exact same contract and come up with entirely different valuations, and you can bet those differences tend to favor higher earnings at each firm. It's quite remarkable really - you end up with this strange situation where both parties can execute what's essentially just a paper transaction and immediately report it as profitable. The whole system creates a dangerous incentive structure where huge amounts of compensation flow from these assumed numbers. This isn't like selling See's Candies where you know exactly what you've earned. When the numbers are this subjective and the compensation this large, you're just asking for trouble. That's why I've always been skeptical of complex derivatives - they can turn accounting into a game of imagination rather than reality."

As I've said, fault me for dithering - or as Charlie more colorfully puts it, thumb-sucking. The key lesson here is crystal clear: when you identify a problem, whether it's with personnel or business operations, the time to act is now. Not tomorrow, not next quarter, but now. Waiting only allows the problem to grow larger, just as we experienced when more trades were put on the books during our period of inaction.

The worrisome part about these obligations is that their potential to explode cannot be measured, and if severe trouble occurs, it's likely to correlate with problems elsewhere in financial markets. That's why I regularly describe our problems in this area - not just to admit my mistakes, but in the hope that our experiences may prove instructive for managers, auditors, and regulators.

Because we had no intention of selling our Gillette shares before the merger, we don't plan to sell our P&G shares now, and we didn't pay any tax when the merger happened. You see this kind of thing in acquisitions too. Take Gillette's purchase of Duracell - the conventional accounting never made visible the billions of dollars that Gillette's shareholders lost because what they received in business value simply wasn't equivalent to what they gave up. This is why I always emphasize looking at the economic fundamentals rather than just the accounting numbers. You've got to look beyond the required bookkeeping entries to understand what's really happening in a business transaction."

But Jim came in and made three critical moves: he instilled fiscal discipline, tightened operations, and energized marketing. The result? A dramatic increase in the intrinsic value of the company. This is why I pay so much attention to management when we look at investments. Before Kilts, Gillette had made some serious missteps - the Duracell acquisition being a prime example of poor capital allocation that cost shareholders billions. One person in the CEO role can make the difference between a struggling company and a thriving one. When you find a CEO who understands capital allocation and operational excellence, and who can execute on both, that's when you see real value creation for shareholders."

The deck is stacked against investors because you typically have a CEO working with their handpicked VP of human relations and a consultant from what I like to call the ever-accommodating firm of Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo. Together, they create compensation packages that are ridiculously out of line with performance. It's not an academic observation - as someone who through Berkshire has paid our share of executive compensation, I can tell you that the relationship between pay and performance is often broken in corporate America.

In the scenario I outlined, Stagnant Inc. earns $1 billion annually on $10 billion of net worth, coming to $10 per share on 100 million shares. The problem is that this compensation structure encourages financial engineering rather than genuine value creation. It's amazing to me that this fundamental yardstick - the actual alignment between management incentives and shareholder interests - is almost always ignored by both managements and their investment bankers when acquisitions are under discussion. This is exactly the kind of compensation arrangement that demonstrates how the system can reward mediocrity while appearing to tie pay to performance."

In Fred's case, this strategy could net him $158 million over ten years without improving the business one bit. The math is quite simple: by reducing the share count from 100 million to 38.7 million through repurchases, earnings per share rise from $10 to $25.80. What's even more remarkable - and troubling - is that Fred could make over $100 million even if earnings declined by 20%. He could also get rich by deploying retained earnings into mediocre projects earning just 5%. The key thing to understand is that any earnings retained, even if poorly deployed, can increase option values while potentially doing nothing for long-term shareholder value.

What troubles me about this situation is the misalignment of interests it creates. Remember, shareholders are told that stock options help align management's interests with their own. But when executives can get rich by simply withholding dividends and doing share buybacks, regardless of actual business performance, that alignment breaks down. The shareholders are left wondering what happened to that supposed alignment of interests they were promised when the options were issued.

Now, CEOs understand this math perfectly well. They know that every single dime paid out in dividends reduces the value of their fixed-price options. What's particularly concerning to me is that while these executives constantly preach internally about how capital comes at a cost, they conveniently forget to mention to shareholders that fixed-price options essentially give them free capital. The real kicker is that this doesn't have to be the case at all. It would be child's play - and I mean absolutely straightforward - for a board to design options that account for the automatic build-up in value that occurs when earnings are retained. But here's the interesting part - you almost never see these kinds of options being issued. The compensation 'experts' - and I use that term loosely - seem to know every management-friendly plan under the sun, but this simple solution appears foreign to them.

Think about this: a CEO can 'earn' more in that single day while cleaning out their desk than an American worker earns in an entire lifetime of cleaning toilets. That's not just wrong - it's obscene. The root of this problem lies in how compensation committees have essentially become slaves to comparative data. They're approving huge severance payments, lavish perks, and outsized payments for what I'd call ho-hum performance. This isn't about rewarding excellence anymore - it's about following a broken industry standard that rewards mediocrity or even failure. The compensation system has become so detached from actual performance that it's creating exactly the wrong incentives. Instead of aligning executive interests with long-term shareholder value, we've created a system where executives can win big even when shareholders lose.

Then they hear about the latest perks that other executives are getting. And what happens? They fall into this childish logic of 'But everyone else is doing it!' I've seen this play out in boardrooms - though I should mention with a chuckle that I've only been put on one compensation committee out of twenty board positions I've held. Hmmmm... wonder why that is! But here's the real issue: when committees use this approach, yesterday's excess becomes today's baseline. It creates this perpetual upward ratchet in executive compensation. Instead of rewarding actual performance, we're rewarding failure. I like to think about Hank Greenberg's approach - you remember, the Detroit slugger. When his son asked about negotiating a bonus for a player batting .246, Hank just said, 'Ask for a uniform.'

It's a complete inversion of what sound business principles would dictate. When I look at compensation practices today, I'm reminded of what real performance-based pay should look like. Take my example of Hank Greenberg - there was a man who understood the connection between performance and reward. He didn't care about what other players were getting; he cared about what you hit last year. That's the kind of straight-line thinking we need to return to in executive compensation.

Now remember, the Gotrocks still own the same businesses - they're just rearranging who owns what. But with each trade, they're paying commissions to these Helpers.

In fact, they'll get less because of the costs involved. Using our Gotrocks family example again - when family members trade with each other, they're not creating any new wealth. The family still owns the same businesses earning the same amount. The only change is that now they're paying Helpers to facilitate these trades, which reduces their collective wealth. Some individual investors might do better than others through trading, but for owners as a whole, there's simply no magic that will enable them to extract wealth beyond what the companies themselves create.

That's what patient, long-term investors could capture. But when investors get too active, trying to outsmart the market with constant buying and selling, they typically reduce their returns. It's like Newton discovered - there's a gravitational pull downward on returns when there's too much motion in your portfolio. That's why I've always advocated for less activity, not more. The mathematics of investing are quite straightforward, but it's the behavior that trips most people up. They feel they need to be constantly doing something, when often the best thing is to do very little."

Now, some folks might look at our balance sheet, especially after consolidating operations like MidAmerican, and think we've changed our stance on borrowing. But that's not the case at all. When we do use debt, it's very targeted. For instance, we'll occasionally use repos as part of short-term investing strategies involving U.S. government securities - but only with the most liquid securities, and these are highly opportunistic moves. Another case where we'll consider debt is when we're dealing with portfolios of interest-bearing receivables where we thoroughly understand the risk characteristics. We did this with Finova in 2001, partnering with Leucadia on a $5.6 billion deal. But these are exceptions, not the rule. Our general philosophy remains the same: we're extremely debt-averse. We believe that avoiding debt gives us the financial strength and flexibility to weather any storm and take advantage of opportunities when they arise."

First, we need to thoroughly understand the risk characteristics of what we're borrowing against. Take our Finova deal in 2001 - we guaranteed $5.6 billion in bank debt because we had a clear understanding of the underlying receivables portfolio. We did something similar with Clayton's manufactured-home receivables. Second, we need to see that the debt is properly matched to stable, predictable cash flows. A good example is MidAmerican, where the debt is backed by highly-stable utility earnings from multiple sources. What's particularly important there is that even if one utility property had problems, the others would still easily cover all debt requirements. I should emphasize that while MidAmerican's debt appears on our consolidated balance sheet, it's their obligation alone - Berkshire doesn't guarantee it. The key is that we're very conservative and won't take on debt unless we're extremely confident in our ability to service it through reliable cash flows we understand well."

But here's the reality: we'd end up making less money that way. We're perfectly happy to show the debt on our balance sheet and wait for the earnings to come in over time if that means better profits in the end. Now, we're not inflexible about this - if market conditions changed to make securitization more attractive, we could certainly sell part of the portfolio and eliminate the related debt. But that's unlikely, and until then, we'll stick with what makes the most economic sense. As I like to say, we prefer better profits to better cosmetics. That's just how we think about these things at Berkshire - we're focused on maximizing long-term value, not making the numbers look good in the short term."

        "value": "Well, it's really quite straightforward. When you have ten different utility operations spread across different regions, you've created a remarkably stable earnings stream. Let me explain why this matters. Each utility operation independently contributes to covering our debt requirements. If something catastrophic were to happen to one utility - let's say what Katrina did to New Orleans' electric utility - the other nine operations would still be generating reliable earnings to cover our debt obligations. This geographic and operational diversity is key. An earthquake in a Western state, for instance, can't take down our entire operation. That's fundamentally different from having a single utility with higher coverage ratios. The regulated nature of utility earnings also provides additional stability. Charlie, who worries about everything, can't even come up with a scenario that would systematically decrease utility earnings in any major way. This is why MidAmerican retains all its earnings - which is quite unusual in the utility industry - and can safely utilize significant debt. It's simply a matter of having multiple independent sources of stable, regulated earnings rather than putting all our eggs in one basket."

I simply won't risk their financial security for some incremental gains. What people often overlook is that a disaster for Berkshire would be a personal disaster for many of our investors. We're not just managing money here - we're managing people's life savings, their retirement funds, their children's college funds. That's a responsibility I take very seriously. So while others might see our debt-averse approach as overly cautious, I see it as appropriately prudent given the trust our shareholders have placed in us. Sometimes the smartest thing you can do in business is to say no to what everyone else thinks is obvious."

You see, we've made promises to our policyholders - some stretching out fifty years or more - and to our investors, many of whom have a large portion of their net worth in our stock. We've promised them total security, regardless of what happens - whether it's financial panics, stock market closures, or even domestic nuclear, chemical or biological attacks. Now, could our investment portfolio take a big hit in certain conditions? Absolutely. We saw that happen on October 19, 1987. But here's what matters: we maintain the net worth, earnings streams, and liquidity to handle any problem with ease. I've seen too many smart people learn the hard way that a long string of impressive numbers multiplied by a single zero equals zero. That's not an equation I want to experience personally, and I certainly don't want to impose it on others. It's really that simple - take the risks, but make absolutely certain you can handle the worst-case scenario."

Then we have people who've been permanently injured, to whom we owe insurance payments stretching out for fifty years or more. These aren't just numbers on a page - these are real commitments to real people. That's why we've promised total security to all these constituencies, no matter what happens. And when I say total security, I mean exactly that - whether we face financial panics, extended stock-exchange closures like in 1914, or even catastrophic events like domestic nuclear, chemical or biological attacks. This isn't just about making money - it's about maintaining the trust these stakeholders have placed in us. Any approach that doesn't prioritize this absolute security is, in my view, dangerous. We take this responsibility very seriously, and it's why we maintain such strong financial foundations. It's not just about protecting wealth - it's about protecting people who depend on us."

You know, we've actually been doing exactly this at GEICO for 26 years with terrific results. It's an attractive position at Berkshire, and I have absolutely no doubt we'll be able to bring in someone excellent for that role.

The reality is that humans age at different rates, and sooner or later, their talents and vigor decline. Some managers stay sharp well into their 80s - just look at Charlie, who's a wonder at 82 - while others start to fade in their 60s. The tricky part is that when abilities ebb, self-assessment abilities usually go with them. That's why our board members are uniquely positioned to make this call. They have extraordinary financial motivation to do so - I don't know of any other board in the country where the directors' financial interests are so completely aligned with shareholders'.

The board has to be ready for two distinct scenarios: First, the obvious case of my death, and second, which is actually more challenging, the case of my gradual decline, particularly if it's accompanied by diminished self-awareness.
