Look at the numbers - we went from spending $31 million on ads in 1995 when Berkshire took control, to $238 million in 2003, and then to $631 million last year. That's an enormous increase, but it's been money well spent. You see, GEICO didn't start fat - it started lean and efficient. This remarkable gain in efficiency has allowed us to pour more money into advertising than any of our competitors, even those much larger than us. And we're going to keep raising the bar. It's like our director Don Keough said in his clever note to me - the results have been so good that shareholders should consider changing their kids' names to Tony or Antoinette! That's the kind of enthusiasm we have for GEICO's performance. The key is that we've maintained our cost advantage while scaling up our marketing presence, which is a rare combination in business."

But we never planned it that way. I started as a security analyst, Charlie as a lawyer, and from those perspectives, we both developed a healthy skepticism about big organizations. What we've observed is that size often makes companies slow-thinking, resistant to change, and smug. Just look at what happened to the giants of 1965 - of the ten largest non-oil companies back then, companies like GM, Sears, DuPont, and Kodak, only one made it to the 2006 list. As Churchill put it, 'We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.' That's exactly what happens to many large organizations - they become shaped by their own size and bureaucracy. So while we've grown large, we've always been mindful of these dangers. We work hard to maintain the agility and decision-making speed of a smaller operation, even as we've grown to our current size. It's not easy, but it's essential to avoid the trap that's caught so many other large enterprises."

But I know I couldn't do their jobs, and frankly, I wouldn't want to. All those meetings, speeches, foreign travel, charity events, dealing with government - that's not for me. As Ronald Reagan said, 'It's probably true that hard work never killed anyone - but why take the chance?' Our approach has worked wonderfully because our managers have returned our trust by working hard and effectively. They run their own operations, and Charlie and I stay out of their way.

The business world is constantly evolving - just look at how among the ten largest non-oil companies by market cap in 1965, only one was still on that list by 2006. Companies like General Motors, Sears, DuPont, and Eastman Kodak all fell from those heights. That's why we need multiple measures and have to look beyond just the numbers. You need to understand the qualitative factors, the corporate culture, the competitive dynamics - all these elements that statistics alone won't show you.

When Eitan, Jacob, and Danny Goldman came to Omaha, I spent just a few hours with them and could immediately see we'd be teaming up with extraordinarily talented managers. You see, in business, it's all about the people running the show. These folks demonstrated they could be trusted to run the business after a sale with the same energy and dedication they'd shown before. Now, I had bought foreign stocks before, but never a whole business outside the U.S., so I did have to educate myself on some tax and jurisdictional matters - that's just proper due diligence. But what really sealed the deal was seeing their operation firsthand in Israel. Charlie and I, along with five Berkshire associates, visited ISCAR, and I can tell you we were all more impressed with that operation than anything we'd ever seen. The brains and energy there were simply ubiquitous.

What makes this business model so attractive is its fundamental value proposition: ISCAR makes money by helping its customers make more money. That's really the best recipe for continued success you can find in business. Their managers - Eitan, Jacob, and their team - are constantly developing tools that make their customers' machines more productive. They're true managerial magicians in that sense. When you have a business that becomes essential to your customers' success, that creates a durable competitive advantage. And when you combine that with outstanding management that keeps innovating and improving their products, well, that's the kind of business we love at Berkshire. It's why we were happy to purchase 80% of ISCAR for $4 billion, with the Wertheimer family remaining as our valued partner with 20%."

Those terrible hurricane seasons of 2004-05 - were they just unusual events, or are they warning signs of what's ahead? Neither Ajit Jain, who runs our super-cat operation, nor I can answer that definitively. But I'll tell you this - it would be naive to think Katrina represents a worst-case scenario. What we're seeing now is that a flood of capital has entered the super-cat field, pushing rates down. So we've responded by sharply reducing our wind exposures. This follows one of our core principles: be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. The fundamental truth in insurance is that appropriate prices don't guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices absolutely guarantee eventual losses. That's why we won't take on even small exposures if the pricing doesn't reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities."

We're facing a crucial question: Were those devastating hurricane seasons of 2004-05 just aberrations, or were they our planet's first warning that we're entering a fundamentally different climate era in the 21st Century? I'll be straight with you - if it's the latter, then 2006 might end up looking like nothing more than a deceptively calm period before a series of devastating storms. And these storms could really shake up the insurance industry. Now, I want to be very clear about something - it would be naive to think of Katrina as anything close to a worst-case scenario. We simply don't know what lies ahead, but we do know one thing: it would be a huge mistake to bet that these evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers. That's why we're being particularly careful about how we evaluate and price these risks. The industry needs to be thinking very seriously about these long-term implications."

You see, the Names at Lloyd's were told they had unlimited liability - right down to their last cufflink, as they used to say. But here's the fascinating part: after 300 years of nothing really terrible happening, people started treating this very real risk as just a formality. I've always said that what you learn from history isn't what's going to happen, but how people behave. In this case, three centuries of retained cufflinks acted like a powerful sedative. People got comfortable, thought they could pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk. But then asbestos claims hit, followed by environmental and product claims in the 1980s, and that comfortable assumption was shattered. The lesson here is clear - just because something hasn't happened in a very long time doesn't mean the risk isn't real. When you're told you have unlimited liability, you better believe it, no matter how many years of smooth sailing you've seen."

You had these policies written decades earlier that were essentially forgotten about - everyone thought they were ancient history. But then the asbestos claims started rolling in, combined with environmental and product claims in the 1980s, and suddenly these old policies developed enormous losses. Nobody - and I mean nobody - could intelligently estimate the total, except that it would clearly run into many tens of billions of dollars. This is why I'm always extremely cautious about long-tail liabilities in insurance. The situation got so bad that Lloyd's basically had to create Equitas in 1996 and endow it with £11.1 billion just to handle pre-1993 claims. The really sobering part is how these seemingly dormant policies could suddenly threaten the entire institution and drive some Names to bankruptcy or worse. When you write an insurance policy, you're making a promise that might not come due for decades, and you better understand exactly what you're promising."

The fundamental truth is that when an industry's economics are deteriorating, even the most brilliant management team can only do so much. They might slow down the decline, but they can't stop it entirely. I'll give you a perfect example from our own experience - the newspaper business. When Charlie and I were young, newspapers were practically a license to print money. If you had the only paper in town, you could hardly avoid making spectacular profits, regardless of how poorly you ran things. As one publisher put it rather candidly, 'I owe my fortune to two great American institutions: monopoly and nepotism.' But look at what's happened since then. Even at our Buffalo News, which has talented management, we're seeing declining profits. The simple reality is that newspapers are no longer the primary source of information for Americans as they were throughout most of the 20th Century. So my advice has always been what a wise friend told me long ago: 'If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get into a good business.' You can't swim against the tide of deteriorating industry fundamentals forever."

What's particularly impressive is that they managed to make 14 acquisitions, spending $291 million, while still paying off their debt to Berkshire and accumulating $35 million in cash. I even joked at their fifth anniversary party that it would be embarrassing if MiTek's stock price surpassed Berkshire's A shares - though Charlie and I will try to keep our shares a moving target! This kind of performance exemplifies what we look for: strong management that can effectively deploy capital through acquisitions while maintaining financial discipline. The fact that they've been able to pay off their debt while growing substantially shows they're not just growing for growth's sake, but doing it in a way that creates real value. It's the kind of business that makes our job easy - we simply provide the capital and let excellent management teams do what they do best.

This created a wonderful circularity that would typically lead to one paper pulling ahead in a city. Once that paper won and competition disappeared, they could raise rates every year for both advertisers and readers. The profits just rolled in. It's interesting that while newspapers would report critically on the profitability of other industries like auto or steel, they never seemed eager to tell their readers about their own incredibly profitable position.

What really struck me was how many smart newspaper executives, people who made their living reporting and analyzing world events, couldn't or wouldn't see what was happening right in front of them. The reality is that newspapers have been fighting a losing battle for eyeballs ever since. I've often thought about it this way: if cable, satellite TV, and the internet had come first, newspapers as we know them probably wouldn't even exist. It's just simple economics - when readers have countless free alternatives just a click away, the traditional newspaper model becomes very difficult to sustain.

Today, every newspaper website is competing with countless alternative sources of information and entertainment, all of them free and instantly accessible. Take our Buffalo News operation - we've done well developing our online presence, and we continue to attract more viewers and advertisers. But here's the reality: when your potential readers have an almost infinite number of free alternatives available at any moment, your ability to generate substantial profits becomes severely limited. Even though we run our operations efficiently and have strong leadership with people like Stan Lipsey and Margaret Sullivan, we can't escape these fundamental economic realities of the digital age.

The internet has fundamentally changed the game for newspapers. You see, when a newspaper's content goes online, it's competing with countless free alternatives that are just a click away. That's a very different situation from the past, where a print newspaper often had little to no direct competition in its local market. What we're finding is that the economic potential of a newspaper's internet presence is, at best, a small fraction of what traditional print operations could achieve in their heyday. This is particularly challenging because newspapers have high fixed costs - that's just the nature of the business. And when your unit volume starts heading south, as we're seeing in many markets, those fixed costs become a real burden. It's simple economics - you can't change your cost structure as quickly as revenues can fall. That's why I always emphasize looking at the fundamental economics of any business.

I've observed that when someone owns a city's paper, they immediately gain a certain status and power that appeals to many people with money. Take Peter Kiewit's purchase of the Omaha paper over 40 years ago - he did it primarily out of civic duty, believing local ownership would benefit the community. But here's my warning to aspiring press lords: there's no guarantee that revenues won't fall below expenses, and losses can snowball quickly. As for our position at Berkshire, we'll stick with the News as long as we're not facing an irreversible cash drain. Charlie and I have a deep personal connection to newspapers - we each read five daily - and we firmly believe they're crucial for maintaining a great democracy.

You see, we're not in derivatives for speculation - we're in them because we sometimes spot situations where they're fundamentally mispriced, creating opportunities for profit. It's really about being patient and waiting for the right opportunities. When we find derivatives that are mispriced, we're willing to step in, but always with a clear understanding of both the potential rewards and the risks involved."

The directors have rightly emphasized the importance of having a successor with the prospect of a long tenure. But I'll be completely frank - we're not as well-prepared on the investment side. We've had a history here - Charlie was once my potential replacement for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has filled that role. Lou is fantastic, a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record managing GEICO's equity portfolio.

You can't just rely on the standard financial models for this. I've seen plenty of brilliant folks who couldn't see the forest for the trees when it comes to risk. What we need is someone with true independent thinking abilities and emotional stability. They need to fundamentally understand how both people and institutions behave. I've met many very intelligent individuals over the years who lacked these essential qualities, and intelligence alone just isn't enough. Think about it this way - over time, markets will do some truly extraordinary, even bizarre things. One big mistake can wipe out years of successes. So we need someone who has that built-in risk radar, combined with the emotional stability to stay steady when others are losing their heads. That's a rare combination, but it's absolutely essential for long-term investment success at Berkshire."

Here's why: they're often collecting directors' fees between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, and for many of them, this represents their primary source of income. When you're relying on those fees to maintain your standard of living, how independent can you really be?

The family's involvement didn't end there - his son, Malcolm 'Kim' Chace, joined our board in 1992 and carried on his father's legacy. Kim proved to be just as wonderful and helpful as his father. He served until recently when he suggested we find someone younger to take his place, as he's now running a community bank he founded in 1996. I owe a great deal to both generations of the Chace family.

I've never once had someone ask me if a potential director 'thinks like an intelligent owner.' Just imagine if a football team selected players this way! They wouldn't ask about athletic ability or specific skills - they'd just be checking demographic boxes. That's not how you build a winning team, and it's not how you build an effective board. Take Susan Decker, who we brought onto our board. Yes, she's younger than me - though who isn't these days? - but that's not why we chose her.

But here's what's interesting - when the company implemented cost-cutting measures and executives had to pay for these services themselves, one of our top executives suddenly decided he only needed a haircut every three weeks instead of weekly. You see, that's human nature at work. When people are spending other people's money, whether it's corporate funds or taxpayer dollars, they often make different decisions than they would with their own wallet. That's why at Berkshire, we're extremely careful with our shareholders' money. Just look at our World Headquarters - we run this entire operation with just 19 employees in about 10,000 square feet of space, including Charlie's office in LA.

Here's a striking way to think about it: if there were just 600 companies paying taxes like Berkshire does, they could cover all federal income and payroll taxes for everyone else in America. That's quite a responsibility we're carrying. And I should mention that our federal tax return last year was 9,386 pages long. It's not just writing a check - we take our tax obligations very seriously. We have to handle not just federal returns, but state and foreign tax returns, plus all the SEC requirements.

We were absolutely right about the concept - reward programs would become huge. But our execution vehicle, Blue Chip Stamps, went in exactly the opposite direction we expected. Here was a business doing $126 million in sales when we bought it, with 60 billion stamps being licked and pasted into books across California. We even had mortuary customers - when you think you've got both dead people and brothels as customers, you figure you've got a sure thing! But from the day we stepped in, it went straight downhill. By 1980, sales had dropped to $19.4 million, then to $1.5 million by 1990, and last year we did just $25,920 in a company that now has $98 billion in revenues.

It's remarkable how quickly behavior changes when it's your own money at stake. I've always said that you need to watch what people do rather than what they say, and this little story illustrates that principle perfectly. The executive's true prioritization of these visits became crystal clear when the payment structure changed. It's a reminder that in business, as in life, if you want to understand true motivations and values, watch what happens when people have to put their own money on the line.

The secret, if you want to call it that, is keeping things both simple and fair. We use different incentive arrangements depending on the business - what works for a capital-intensive operation might not work for another type. But here's the key: when we use incentives, and yes, they can be quite large, they're always tied directly to the operating results that CEO can control. We don't play games with lottery tickets or rewards disconnected from business performance. Let me give you an analogy I like to use - if a CEO bats .300, they get paid for being a .300 hitter, even if Berkshire as a whole might struggle that year for reasons beyond their control. Conversely, if they bat .150, they don't get rewarded just because other parts of Berkshire are doing well. It's that straightforward."

It's peculiar when you think about it. Here I am, successfully managing compensation for dozens of CEOs at Berkshire with a proven track record of retention and performance, yet other boards seemed reluctant to have me involved in their compensation decisions. I believe this reflects a fundamental difference in philosophy. At Berkshire, we focus on clear, performance-based incentives tied to results within each CEO's control. We don't believe in disconnecting pay from performance or creating complex schemes that reward factors outside a manager's influence. Take our $61 billion equity portfolio - its value might swing by 10% in a year, but we don't let that affect how we compensate our operating managers.

Look, if someone bats .150, they shouldn't get a big payoff just because other people's successes have made Berkshire prosper. I believe in paying for performance, but it needs to be performance that the executive can actually influence. You wouldn't pay a baseball player based on how the stock market performs, would you?

You see, many stocks trade their entire outstanding shares every year - that's 100% turnover - and they still tend to sell at reasonable prices reflecting their intrinsic value. Berkshire only trades about 15% of its shares annually, so even with these additional foundation sales, we're nowhere near the volume that could materially impact price. The fundamental principle here is that a company's business performance, not trading volume, determines its stock price over time. Charlie and I are committed to ensuring Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor premium to intrinsic value through our policies and communications.

        "value": "The Gotrocks situation is really quite fascinating, and frankly, a bit sad. Let me explain why this continues to happen. First, there's this persistent delusion about obtainable returns that many investors cling to. Some of this is actually self-serving - take private pension plans, for instance. They can temporarily make their earnings look better by using unrealistic investment assumptions. Public pension plans do the same thing to avoid raising taxes. And here's the troubling part - actuaries and auditors just go along with it. The real problem might not surface for decades, and by then, the CEO or public official who created this mess is long gone. But there's another piece to this puzzle. Wall Street - what I call the 'Pied Pipers of Performance' - keeps encouraging these futile hopes. They convince the Gotrocks family - which represents all investors - that everyone can somehow achieve above-average performance. Of course, this magical performance comes with a catch: ever-higher fees. It's a self-destructive cycle that continued right through 2006, and unfortunately, we still see it today. The family keeps falling for this despite the mathematical impossibility of everyone being above average, especially after paying substantial fees to 'helpers.'"

        "value": "Well, let me break down this lopsided system for you. The 2-and-20 arrangement means you're paying 2% of your principal each year to the manager regardless of performance - they could lose you money and still collect this fee. Then, they take 20% of any profits they generate. Let me give you a concrete example of why this math is so grotesque: If a manager achieves a 10% gross return, they'll keep 3.6 percentage points - that's the 2% management fee plus 20% of the remaining 8 points - leaving only 6.4% for the investors. Now, here's the real kicker: on a $3 billion fund, that manager would pocket $108 million in fees, even if an index fund delivered 15% returns in the same period with minimal fees. It reminds me of that old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to someone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with experience ends up with the money. This arrangement is mathematically certain to make investors poorer over time than if they'd never heard of these 'hyper-helpers.'"

But here's the reality: these Pied Pipers are encouraging futile hopes while charging ever-higher fees for their services. In 2006, we saw this reach new heights with institutional investors flooding money to these managers. What's particularly troubling is how they assure the hapless investors - let's call them the Gotrocks family - that they can all achieve superior performance, but only by paying these increasingly expensive fees. It's a classic case of Wall Street's salesmanship overwhelming arithmetic common sense. The math simply doesn't work - it's impossible for everyone to be above average, and when you factor in these excessive fees, it becomes even more apparent that these promises are hollow. These performance promises are particularly dangerous because they prey on investors' hopes while simultaneously picking their pockets through fee structures that guarantee the managers get rich while investors bear the risk."

Here was a man who didn't go to business school or even college, operated from one file cabinet that grew to just four over decades, and worked without any support staff except his son Edwin. What made Walter remarkable was his adherence to fundamental principles. He and Edwin simply tried to 'buy stocks cheap' using basic statistical methods learned from Ben Graham. They never came within a mile of inside information and used outside information sparingly. The beauty of Walter's approach was that it involved no real risk - and by that I mean permanent loss of capital. This simple strategy, consistently applied over 47 years, produced returns that dramatically beat the S&P 500. But what's equally important is Walter's integrity. From 1956 to 2002, he wouldn't take a dime unless his investors made money. That's why 50 years ago, when a St. Louis family asked me for a recommendation for an honest and able investment manager, Walter was my sole choice."

Now contrast this with Walter Schloss's approach. Walter only made money when his investors made money - that's true alignment of interests. He didn't take fees just for managing money; he had to perform. This is a stark difference from the 2-and-20 structure where managers get paid regardless of performance. Walter's approach was based on genuine value creation for his clients, not fee extraction. He proved that successful investment management doesn't require fancy offices, complex strategies, or layers of fees. Just one file cabinet that grew to four, basic statistical methods, and a commitment to buying stocks cheap. That's how you truly serve your investors."

Over 47 years, he consistently outperformed the S&P 500 by investing in around 1,000 different securities, mostly unremarkable ones. Now, if the efficient market theory were correct - that stock prices always reflect all available information and can't be consistently beaten - Walter's achievement would have been impossible. The academics teaching EMT claimed no investor could outperform the market using publicly available information. But Walter did exactly that, and not through luck or a few lucky picks. If you had millions of investment managers randomly picking stocks when Walter did and selling when he sold, even the luckiest one wouldn't have come close to his record. There's simply no way to explain his 47-year performance through chance. What's particularly telling is how the academic community responded when I presented this evidence in 1984. Instead of reconsidering their theories in light of this clear contradiction, they simply ignored it. They closed their eyes rather than opening their minds. That's a perfect example of how theoretical constructs can blind people to practical reality in investing."

That's the only kind of risk that truly matters in investing. What's fascinating about Walter's method is that he didn't rely on complex algorithms, technical analysis, or macroeconomic forecasting. Instead, he built his track record by investing in about 1,000 securities, and here's the key point - most of them were what you'd call lackluster stocks. He wasn't hitting home runs with a few spectacular picks. This is crucial because it demonstrates that superior investment results don't require finding the next Amazon or Apple. His success came from consistently identifying mispriced securities while maintaining strict risk discipline. The fact that he did this with such mundane investments, and did it consistently over nearly five decades, proves that successful investing doesn't require fancy theories or complex strategies. It requires patience, discipline, and a clear understanding of value."

Look at Walter's performance - here was clear evidence challenging their theory, but to my knowledge, not a single business school teaching EMT made any effort to study what his results meant for their theory. They just kept teaching EMT as if it were gospel truth. You know, it reminds me of what happened to Galileo - any finance professor who dared question EMT had about the same chance of getting promoted as Galileo had of becoming Pope. The real tragedy is that they sent tens of thousands of students into the world believing something that wasn't true - that stock prices were always 'right' and that trying to evaluate businesses was pointless. It's like teaching sailors that the earth is flat - it makes life easier for those who know better. The irony is that this academic blindness actually made it easier for smart investors like Walter to outperform, since everyone else was operating under these misguided assumptions."

Think about that - these were business schools teaching students not to analyze businesses! The result was that while Walter and other smart investors were out there finding mispriced stocks and generating superior returns, these graduates were operating under the assumption that such analysis was futile. It's similar to what I mentioned about the shipping business - if all your competitors believe the earth is flat, it gives you a tremendous advantage if you know it's round. That's essentially what happened here. The schools' rigid adherence to EMT created a generation of investors who were handicapped by their own education, while making it easier for those who rejected this theory to find opportunities in the market. As I noted somewhat tongue-in-cheek, maybe it was actually fortunate for his investors that Walter didn't attend college - he might have had these incorrect ideas drummed into his head too."
