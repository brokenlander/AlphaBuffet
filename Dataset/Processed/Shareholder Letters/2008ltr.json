The credit markets essentially became dysfunctional - and in many important ways, non-functional entirely. Think about it this way: the situation got so bad that everyone started living by that old restaurant saying I used to see: 'In God we trust; all others pay cash.' What made this crisis particularly severe was how it created this vicious spiral. You see, when people got scared about the financial institutions having life-threatening problems, they pulled back. That fear led businesses to contract, which created even more fear. It's like a snowball rolling downhill, gathering size and speed. The fourth quarter was especially dramatic - business activity went into a freefall at a pace I'd never witnessed before. And remember, I've seen quite a few cycles in my time. This wasn't just a U.S. problem - it trapped much of the world in this negative feedback loop. The fear was paralyzing, and it fed on itself. When you combine the credit crisis with tumbling home and stock prices, you created a perfect storm that left investors of all types bloodied and confused - much like small birds that had strayed into a badminton game, as I like to say."

What we saw was a complete shift from the traditional approach of careful, measured responses. Instead of economic medicine being handed out by the cupful, they started dispensing it by the barrel. These were dosages that would have been unthinkable in the past. Now, this massive intervention is bound to have consequences. While we can't predict the exact nature of these aftereffects - that's anyone's guess - I believe one likely outcome will be an onslaught of inflation. But there's another challenge that's developing: we're creating a dependency problem. Major industries have already become reliant on Federal assistance, and we're going to see cities and states coming forward with mind-boggling requests for help. This creates a political challenge that shouldn't be underestimated - weaning these entities from the public teat won't be easy. It's like turning off the spigot once everyone's gotten used to the flow. These are the kinds of long-term consequences we need to be thinking about as we evaluate the full impact of these extraordinary government actions."

While I'm generally a believer in free markets, I recognize that strong and immediate government action was absolutely essential during the financial crisis to prevent a total breakdown of our financial system. The consequences of inaction would have been cataclysmic for every area of our economy. But here's the challenge we're facing now - we've created a dependency problem. Major industries have become reliant on federal assistance, and now cities and states are lining up with mind-boggling requests. It's like having a group of very large, very hungry birds that you've been feeding - they're not going to voluntarily stop coming to the feeder. The political challenge of weaning these entities from the public teat, as I call it, is going to be enormous. They won't leave willingly. We need to recognize that while emergency intervention was necessary, creating long-term dependencies can be dangerous for our economic system. The inhabitants of Wall Street, Main Street, and the various Side Streets of America were all in the same boat during the crisis, but we can't make government support a permanent solution."

We weathered a dozen or so panics and recessions. We survived virulent inflation that pushed the prime rate to 21.5% in 1980. During the Great Depression, unemployment wasn't just high - it stayed between 15% and 25% for many years. But here's the remarkable thing: despite all these obstacles, the real standard of living for Americans improved nearly seven-fold during the 1900s. The Dow Jones Industrials rose from 66 to 11,497. That's not just numbers - that's real progress in how people lived. Compare that to the dozens of centuries before where humans made only tiny gains, if any, in their standard of living. Our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time. Yes, the path hasn't been smooth - it never is - but our system has unleashed human potential like no other system in history. And I'm confident it will continue to do so."

You see, Charlie and I have learned over the years that you can't predict when the economy will be in shambles - like we knew it would be in 2009 - or when the stock market will rise or fall. Nobody can, though plenty of folks think they can. What you can do is build your fortress so strong that you can weather any storm. That's why we maintain this position regardless of whether we're in good years or bad. It's like having a strong foundation for a house - without it, everything else becomes irrelevant when the storms come. This approach has served us extraordinarily well over time, allowing our economic system to work as it should, unleashing human potential even during difficult periods.

In fact, in 75% of those years, the S&P stocks recorded a gain. Now, does that mean we won't have bad years? Of course not. We knew 2009 would be rough, and we knew many of our businesses would earn below their potential during that period. But here's the key thing to understand: short-term economic difficulties don't change the fundamental strength of our economic system. It has unleashed human potential like no other system has, and it will continue to do so. That's why Charlie and I focus on our four key goals regardless of economic conditions. We're building for the long term, developing new earnings streams, widening our moats, and working with outstanding managers. You see, being realistic about short-term challenges while maintaining long-term optimism isn't contradictory - it's precisely how you need to think to be successful in business over the long haul."

This isn't just conservative thinking - it's vital for long-term success. Think about 2008 - while many businesses were struggling, our strong financial position allowed us to weather the storm. We're like a fortress that can withstand any economic hurricane. The other three goals flow from this foundation: we work on widening the competitive moats around our businesses, we constantly seek new and varied earnings streams, and we focus on finding and keeping exceptional managers. But that Gibraltar-like position is really the cornerstone. Without it, you can't take advantage of opportunities when they arise, and you can't protect yourself when times get tough.

Let me explain why this is so valuable. In 2008, when many of our retail and manufacturing businesses were feeling the economic headwinds, our insurance and utility groups delivered outstanding results. This isn't a coincidence. Take our insurance operations - we generated an underwriting gain for the sixth straight year, even though we couldn't match 2007's exceptional results. What's particularly sweet about this is that our insurance float - that's $58.5 billion of other people's money that we get to invest for our benefit - actually cost us less than zero. It's like getting paid to borrow money. When you combine these stable, non-correlated earnings streams with our other businesses, you get a powerful combination. Sure, our retailers and businesses tied to housing construction took some hits, but the diversity and stability provided by insurance and utilities helped maintain our overall strength. That's why I always emphasize having these kinds of foundational businesses that can perform well regardless of what's happening in the broader economy."

Let me explain what I mean by that. In 2008, we held $58.5 billion of insurance float, which is money that doesn't belong to us but that we get to invest for our benefit. Most insurance companies experience substantial underwriting losses over time, which means they're effectively paying to hold their float. But we've achieved underwriting gains for six straight years - in fact, we were paid $2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008. Now, I should be clear - we will have underwriting losses in some years, that's just the nature of the insurance business. But we have the best managers in the insurance business overseeing valuable, entrenched franchises. That's why I'm confident we'll continue to earn underwriting profits over the long term, making our float essentially cost-free capital.

We saw this particularly well in our utility business, where we have outstanding managers in Dave Sokol and Greg Abel achieving unmatched results. I especially appreciate their new projects because in this capital-intensive business, these ventures are typically large-scale, giving Berkshire the opportunity to deploy substantial sums at decent returns. This is exactly the kind of opportunity we look for - when others are fearful, we can put significant capital to work at attractive prices. The key is having the patience to wait for these opportunities and the courage to act when they appear."

During periods of market disarray, like what we saw, Berkshire gets opportunities that simply wouldn't exist in normal markets. For example, in our insurance portfolios, we were able to make three large investments on terms that should add about $1.5 billion pre-tax to our annual earnings, with potential capital gains on top of that. We also completed the Marmon acquisition, taking 64% ownership. These opportunities came because of market pessimism, not in spite of it. You see, when markets are in disarray, quality merchandise gets marked down, just like socks at a department store.

But equally important were the errors of omission - cases where I sat there sucking my thumb when new facts came in that should have caused me to re-examine my thinking and take prompt action. This is a crucial distinction in investing. Sometimes the costliest mistakes aren't from the actions you take, but from the actions you don't take when circumstances change. Now, while these mistakes affected us, it's important to keep perspective. Even when the market value of our bonds and stocks declined significantly with the general market, Charlie and I weren't bothered by this. The key is to learn from these mistakes while maintaining the discipline to stick with sound investment principles.

In fact, MidAmerican hasn't paid a dividend since Berkshire bought in back in 2000. Now, you might ask why we do this. It's pretty straightforward - we reinvest all those earnings to develop and maintain the utility systems that our customers need and deserve. In return for this commitment to infrastructure, regulators allow us to earn a fair return on our invested capital. It's really a win-win situation - customers get reliable service and necessary infrastructure, we get a reasonable return, and regulators get a utility focused on long-term service quality rather than short-term dividends.

These buyout firms essentially played a semantic game - they simply changed their name to 'private equity' without changing any of their fundamental practices. It's what I'd call Orwellian. They kept the same fee structures and their appetite for leverage that they've always had. The irony here is that there's nothing particularly 'private equity' about what they do. In fact, it's quite the opposite. When these firms buy a business, they typically slash the actual equity portion of the capital structure compared to what existed before. What we're seeing now is the dangerous outcome of this approach. Many companies they bought just two or three years ago are in serious trouble because of all the debt these private equity firms piled on them. You can see this in the markets - much of the bank debt is trading below 70 cents on the dollar, and the public debt is doing even worse. And here's what's particularly telling: when these companies desperately need equity now, these private equity firms are nowhere to be found. They're keeping their remaining funds very private indeed. It's a clear example of how excessive leverage can turn otherwise decent businesses into very risky investments."

Unlike many other industries, you won't find large family-owned businesses in the regulated utility sector. The key decision makers aren't actually the selling shareholders - they're the regulators who must judge whether a buyer is fit to operate these essential services. What I find particularly important about this process is its transparency. You can't hide your track record when you're standing before these regulators. They have a very thorough process - they'll call their counterparts in other states where you operate and investigate every aspect of your business operations. They're particularly interested in your willingness to commit adequate equity capital. I can give you a concrete example of this: when MidAmerican proposed to purchase PacifiCorp in 2005, regulators in all six new states we would be serving immediately checked our record in Iowa. This regulatory scrutiny actually aligns perfectly with our long-term approach to business. We commit real equity capital and focus on sustainable operations rather than financial engineering."

The playbook was clear: ignore down payments, engage in fakery - like that $2,000 cat story I mentioned where salesmen would inflate values to get their commissions - and write loans with impossible-to-meet monthly payments to borrowers who had nothing to lose. Then Wall Street would package these mortgages and sell them to unsuspecting investors. The losses were staggering. But here's the remarkable thing - and not in a good way: investors, government, and rating agencies learned absolutely nothing from this disaster. Instead, they went ahead and repeated exactly the same mistakes with conventional homes in 2004-07.

The proof is in the results: not a single purchaser of Clayton's securitized mortgages has ever lost a dime of principal or interest. That's quite a record when you consider that industrywide losses were absolutely staggering. You see, we understood something fundamental that others chose to ignore: you can't lend money to people who can't repay it and expect good results. While the industry was busy writing loans that borrowers couldn't possibly repay from their incomes, we stuck to our principles. It's worth noting that industry unit sales have been declining since their peak of 372,843 in 1998, showing the long-term impact of those poor practices.

It's what I call the Scarlett O'Hara approach to lending - 'I'll think about it tomorrow.' The reality is that counting on asset appreciation to make an unaffordable loan affordable is just asking for trouble. And when this behavior becomes widespread, as it did during the 2004-2007 period, the consequences end up reverberating through every corner of our economy.

Yet our delinquency rate was just 3.6% at yearend, up only slightly from 2.9% in earlier years. Our foreclosure rate actually improved from 5.3% in 2004 to 3.0% in 2008. Meanwhile, we saw many mortgage pools filled with supposedly 'better' borrowers, with higher FICO scores, performing far worse. The key point here is that FICO scores alone don't tell the whole story. What matters more is having a lending process that truly assesses whether borrowers can repay their loans from their actual incomes. We didn't play the game of making loans that only worked if house prices kept rising. Our borrowers might have modest incomes and far-from-great credit scores, but they were given loans they could actually afford to repay.

You see, they approached homeownership the way Jimmy Stewart would have liked - with the intention of paying off their mortgage regardless of what happened to home prices. They didn't play games with teaser rates or count on refinancing to make their payments. They didn't speculate on home prices going up so they could flip the property. Now, these are folks with modest incomes and not-so-great credit scores, but they've performed better than many prime borrowers because they followed this basic principle. It's like the old saying - if you want to know if you can afford something, look at your actual wallet, not your expected lottery winnings.

Our borrowers typically don't have substantial savings to fall back on when these challenges hit. That's why we expect to see more troubles as unemployment rises - it's inevitable. But here's the key difference in our approach: our problems won't be primarily driven by home price trends. We knew going in that our borrowers were taking out these mortgages to live in these homes, not to speculate on real estate prices. They made their decisions based on their ability to pay, not on hopes of rising home values. This is why we've maintained manageable loss rates even in difficult times. Sure, we'll have our share of problems when the economy turns down, but they'll be tied to real-life circumstances, not financial speculation or fancy mortgage products that people couldn't really afford in the first place."

Many folks think foreclosures happen primarily because homes become worth less than their mortgages - what people call 'upside-down' loans. But that's not the core issue at all. The reality is much simpler: foreclosures occur because people can't make their monthly payments. Period. Let me tell you something important - when someone has made a real down payment, coming from their actual savings rather than more borrowing, they rarely walk away from their primary home just because its value has dropped below the mortgage amount. They walk away when they simply can't keep up with those monthly payments anymore. This is why I've always emphasized that the monthly payment needs to fit comfortably within the borrower's verified income. You see, we're looking at the wrong end of the telescope if we focus too much on home values. The real issue is cash flow - can the homeowner consistently make those payments? That's what matters. It's a straightforward principle that sometimes gets lost in all the complex commentary about housing markets."

First, people need to buy homes for the right reasons - enjoyment and utility should be the primary motives, not profit or refinancing possibilities. That's fundamental. Now, let me outline what I consider the essential rules for stable home ownership: You need a genuine down payment of at least 10% - and I mean real savings, not borrowed money. The monthly payments must be something the borrower can handle comfortably from their income - and that income needs to be carefully verified, not just assumed or stated. We've gotten away from these principles, and it's caused problems. You know, we've sometimes gotten our national priorities mixed up. While putting people into homes is a good goal, it shouldn't be our primary objective. What we really should focus on is keeping people in their homes. That's the real measure of success. These aren't complicated ideas, but they're crucial for creating stability in the housing market. When we follow these principles, we protect both the buyers and the overall market."

These companies faced declining rates in their core business and made what I consider a fundamental mistake - they drifted into increasingly risky propositions, particularly in residential mortgage obligations.

This wasn't some casual proposal - it involved real, substantial risk for Berkshire since we'd be committing to cover any losses for up to 40 years in some cases. But here's the interesting part - they rejected our offer, rather rudely in some cases. And you know what? That rejection turned out to be wonderful news for Berkshire because I had actually underpriced our offer significantly. We ended up writing about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market instead, and here's the kicker - about 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by these same three monolines who had turned us down.

You see, when people point to the historically low default rates on municipal bonds, they're looking at data that mostly comes from uninsured bonds. That's because bond insurance didn't even exist before 1971, and even after that, most bonds remained uninsured. Here's the key insight: when a bond is uninsured, you get a very different dynamic in times of trouble. Let me give you the perfect example - New York City in 1975. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy, but most of its bonds were held by local wealthy residents, New York banks, and local institutions. These stakeholders had every incentive to work things out, and they did. They made concessions, they cooperated, they found solutions. Why? Because without a solution, they knew they'd face severe financial losses. But when you add insurance to the mix, you fundamentally change these dynamics. The bondholders have less incentive to work things out because they're protected. So while everyone points to these historical default rates, they're missing this crucial difference in incentives. That's why we remain very cautious about this business - it's not the sure thing that many people seem to think it is."

These investors already have insurance, but they're willing to pay extra for our guarantee on top of it. That tells you something about the market's assessment of various guarantees. However, I should emphasize that despite this competitive advantage, we maintain a very cautious approach to writing this business. We don't let our strong market position make us overconfident about the fundamental economics. In fact, I'm still not entirely certain this insurance will ultimately be profitable for us.

But here's the key point: if Berkshire had insured all those bonds, do you think the same sacrifices would have happened? Not a chance. Instead of local stakeholders working together to solve the problem, they would have looked to us, with our deep pockets, to bear a substantial portion of the pain. You see, when a city has all its bonds insured, it creates what I'd call a moral hazard. The local government becomes more likely to choose solutions that are less favorable to bondholders because they're not directly hurting their local citizens and businesses. It's simple human nature - what mayor or city council member is going to choose imposing major tax increases on their local voters when they can push the pain onto a distant insurance company? This is particularly concerning because we're looking at some serious fiscal challenges ahead for local governments, especially with those pension liabilities I've been warning about.

It's like watching dominos fall - once the first one goes, others are likely to follow. And here's what makes this particularly concerning: these losses tend to be highly correlated among issuers. We're looking at a future where local governments are facing unprecedented fiscal challenges, especially with those massive pension liabilities I mentioned in last year's report. When communities checked their funding status at the end of 2008, many were horrified by what they saw - the gap between assets and realistic actuarial valuations of their liabilities was staggering. This creates a situation where multiple municipalities might face similar pressures at the same time, and if they all have insured bonds, they might all look to solve their problems the same way - by pushing the losses onto insurers rather than making tough local decisions. That's why I prefer seeing bonds held by local banks and residents - it keeps the incentives aligned and encourages more responsible fiscal behavior."

You know, if just looking up past financial data could tell you what the future holds, as I like to say, the Forbes 400 would be filled with librarians. The same fallacy shows up when people try to project loss experience from non-insured bonds onto insured bonds. They look similar on the surface, but they're fundamentally different animals. Back-tested models are particularly susceptible to this kind of error, yet Wall Street keeps touting them as reliable guides for future action.

It's a matter of political incentives - what mayor or city council is going to choose local pain over making it somebody else's problem? That's why we're approaching this business very carefully, and we're staying away from many types of bonds that other monoline insurers regularly take on. You see, in insurance, it's not just about understanding the mathematical probabilities - you have to understand human nature and incentives.

I'm particularly skeptical of these fancy mathematical models that come dressed up with sophisticated-sounding Greek letters like beta, gamma, and sigma.

The regulators were claiming both enterprises were 'financially sound and well managed' while massive accounting shenanigans had been going on right under their noses. What's particularly interesting is that when OFHEO finally acknowledged the problems in 2006 with their 340-page report, they managed to blame everyone except themselves and Congress - the very entities responsible for oversight. This shows us that having more regulatory bodies and more people watching doesn't guarantee better results. What matters is the quality and effectiveness of oversight, not just its presence.

Suddenly, all these protective positions would have become worthless.

This is why I've always said derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction. The counterparty risk isn't just about one transaction or one company - it's about the potential for system-wide failure when these interconnected positions start to unravel."

One party gets their cash, the other gets their securities, and that's that. The counterparty risk essentially disappears because the settlement is quick and clean. That's exactly why the NYSE and NASDAQ moved to shorten settlement from five days to three days back in 1995 - they understood that rapid settlement helps maintain market integrity. But derivatives are a different animal altogether. These contracts can stay unsettled for years, sometimes decades. During that time, counterparties build up enormous claims against each other. You end up with these 'paper' assets and liabilities on financial statements that won't be validated for many years. What's particularly concerning is how this creates what I call a frightening web of mutual dependence among major financial institutions. We saw this play out during the Bear Stearns situation, where the Fed had to step in to prevent what they diplomatically called 'substantial further dislocation in markets.' In plain English, they were worried about a financial chain reaction that nobody could predict the end of."

What happened there was very instructive. When Bear's derivative counterparties suddenly realized their protective financial positions weren't operative anymore, it could have triggered a massive chain reaction. As Tim Geithner from the New York Fed explained, these counterparties would have rushed to liquidate their collateral and tried to replicate their positions in already fragile markets. The Fed had to step in - and in my opinion, they were right to do so - because nobody could predict the magnitude of the financial chain reaction that might have followed. This really demonstrates how interconnected our financial institutions have become through these derivative contracts. When one major player starts to wobble, it's not just about that one institution anymore. The web of mutual dependence that's developed among huge financial institutions means that one failure can cascade through the system in ways that are hard to quantify or predict. That's why I've always been cautious about derivatives and their potential to create systemic risks that aren't immediately visible on financial statements."

When you have these huge financial institutions dealing with billions in receivables and payables, you create what I call a frightening web of mutual dependence. It's not unlike that old saying about relationships - it's not just who you're dealing with directly, but who they're dealing with too. I use that analogy about avoiding venereal disease because it makes the point clear - you're exposed not just to your immediate partner but to their whole network of connections. What makes this particularly dangerous is that these dealers are often already highly-leveraged in other ways. And here's the real kicker - these 'paper' assets and liabilities that show up on financial statements? We won't know their true value for years. That's what makes this whole system so precarious. When you have this level of interconnection between major financial players, one failure can cascade through the entire system. That's why I believe the CEO of any large financial organization must also be the Chief Risk Officer - you need to understand these risks at the deepest level."

Here's the troubling reality - if you're running a large financial institution, modest incompetence won't get you saved by the government. But if you create mind-boggling screw-ups? Well, then you become what we call 'too big to fail.' You see, when a company becomes so large and interconnected that their problems can infect the entire neighborhood, they become a concern of the state. And while I sadly have to admit this government intervention is proper to prevent system-wide collapse, it creates a terrible incentive. These large derivatives dealers know that by 'sleeping around' - to use my earlier metaphor - they're actually making themselves more likely to receive government aid if trouble hits. It's why some CEOs pile on leverage and run large, unfathomable derivatives books. They know that if they make themselves important enough to the system, they're almost guaranteed a bailout. This is why at Berkshire, we take a completely different approach - we only enter derivatives contracts that I believe were mispriced at inception, and I personally monitor every position."

The key difference in our approach is that we only enter contracts that we believe were mispriced at inception, sometimes quite dramatically so. But here's the really important part: we structure these deals so that we always hold the money upfront. Our counterparties make payments to us when contracts are initiated, which means we have no meaningful counterparty risk. As of the last count, this created what I call derivatives 'float' of $8.1 billion. Think of it like our insurance float - if we just break even on the underlying transaction, we've had the use of free money for an extended period. And we expect, though it's not guaranteed, to do better than break even, with our investment income on these funds being what I like to call 'frosting on the cake.' If we lose money on derivatives, I've been very clear - it will be my fault."

Just look at what happened to Constellation Energy - they were within hours of bankruptcy before MidAmerican stepped in with a rescue. At Berkshire, we've deliberately structured our operations to minimize this risk. Only a small percentage of our contracts require any collateral posting when markets move against us. Even during the chaos of last year's fourth quarter - and believe me, it was chaotic - we had to post less than 1% of our securities portfolio. And here's another important detail: when we do have to post collateral, we deposit it with third parties while still keeping the investment earnings on those deposited securities. We actually warned about these dangers in our 2002 annual report, and time has proven that warning prescient. The key is to structure your operations so you're never at the mercy of market movements forcing you to post collateral you can't afford. That's why we're so conservative in how we structure these agreements from the start."

In fact, I'll tell you something interesting - we actually view the 'downs' as potentially helpful because they can create opportunities for us to expand our positions on more favorable terms. You see, what matters isn't the short-term accounting variance, but the eventual result. We use two different methods to insure bonds, and while they'll ultimately produce the same accounting outcome, there can be substantial differences in reported profits in the short term. I want our shareholders to think about these swings the same way we do - they're just accounting entries that don't reflect the fundamental economics of our derivative positions. The key is to focus on the long-term results rather than getting caught up in quarterly fluctuations."

But here's the important thing to understand - when you try to apply it to extended time periods, it can produce some truly absurd results. Let me give you a specific example: take a 100-year $1 billion put option on the S&P 500 with a strike price of 903. Using the formula with our standard implied volatility assumptions for long-dated contracts, along with appropriate interest and dividend assumptions, Black-Scholes would tell you the premium should be $2.5 million. Now, I believe Black and Scholes themselves understood the limitations of their formula quite well. The problem is that their followers might be overlooking whatever cautionary notes the two men included when they first presented their work. It's like many things in finance - a useful tool within certain parameters, but not something to be followed blindly, especially when pushed to extremes."

Let me give you the farm analogy I often use: Imagine you have a neighbor who's manic-depressive, and every day they give you a different quote on what they think your farm is worth. Now, would you use the volatility calculated from these erratic daily quotes to predict what that farm might be worth a century from now? Of course not! That's essentially what Black-Scholes does. While historical volatility can be somewhat useful for short-term options, its relevance diminishes rapidly as the time horizon extends. In our case, we're looking at options that could be 100 years long, where we'd pay nothing 99% of the time under my assumptions. Even in the worst 1% case scenario with a total loss of $1 billion, our effective borrowing cost would only be 6.2%. When the formula suggests we should pay ridiculous premiums for such scenarios, it's clear that either my assumptions are crazy or the formula isn't appropriate for these time frames."

        "value": "The relationship between duration and Black-Scholes reliability is actually quite straightforward, though not many people think about it this way. What we've found is that while Black-Scholes can be a useful - though still not foolproof - tool for valuing short-term options, its reliability deteriorates significantly as the time horizon lengthens. The core issue lies in how the formula uses volatility. Think about it: we're taking stock price movements from some past period - could be days, months, or years - and using that to predict probability-weighted outcomes decades into the future. That's like trying to predict the long-term value of a business based on its daily stock fluctuations. The longer the time horizon, the less relevant this historical volatility becomes. That's why when we look at our long-term equity puts, I believe the Black-Scholes valuations overstate our actual liability. Now, it's worth noting that this overstatement does tend to diminish as the contracts get closer to maturity. Despite these concerns, we still use Black-Scholes for our financial statements because it's the accepted standard. But it's important to understand its limitations, especially when dealing with very long-term options."
