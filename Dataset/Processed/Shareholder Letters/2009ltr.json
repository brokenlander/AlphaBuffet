You see, we never want to fall into that common trap of looking at where performance landed and then conveniently drawing the target around it afterward. That's why we chose the S&P 500 as our benchmark. It's really quite simple - our shareholders can match the S&P's performance practically for free through an index fund. So if we're not beating that benchmark, why should they pay us to manage their money? Now, we did wrestle with exactly how to measure Berkshire against the S&P. Stock price movement is one valid approach, and over a long enough time period, it's probably the best measure. But the key thing I want everyone - especially our 65,000 new shareholders from the BNSF acquisition - to understand is that these measurement principles aren't just temporary guidelines. They're fundamental to how we operate, they're spelled out clearly in our annual reports, and they'll continue guiding Berkshire long after I'm gone. We believe having these clear, consistent standards helps our shareholders understand exactly what they're getting with Berkshire."

This isn't just about transparency - it's about making sure everyone who owns a piece of Berkshire understands our operations, our goals, what we can and cannot do, and the culture that drives our decision-making. That's precisely why we take the time in every annual report to restate our economic principles. Think of it as both a freshman orientation for our newcomers and a refresher course for our veterans. These principles aren't just words on paper - they're the guidelines we've followed for decades and will continue to guide this company long after I'm no longer here. We've put these principles in pages 89-94 of the annual report, and I strongly encourage everyone, but especially our new shareholders, to read them carefully. It's part of our commitment to ensuring that every owner knows exactly what they're invested in and how we think about running their company."

Look, market prices can be extraordinarily erratic year to year. Even decade-long evaluations can get distorted by irrationally high or low prices at the start or end points. Just ask Steve Ballmer at Microsoft or Jeff Immelt at GE about inheriting companies when their stocks were at nosebleed prices. What we really want to track is the change in Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value. But here's the problem - you can't calculate that with any real precision. So we use what I'd call a crude proxy: per-share book value. Now, I'll be the first to admit this has its shortcomings. Book value typically understates intrinsic value at most companies, and that's definitely true at Berkshire. In our insurance operations, that gap is actually huge. But Charlie and I still believe book value, even with its limitations, gives us the most useful tracking device for changes in intrinsic value. Using this measure, we've grown at 20.3% annually since 1965. That's actually a bit lower than our market price growth of 22%, but we think it's a more reliable yardstick."

This isn't unique to us - it happens at most companies - but at Berkshire, the difference is particularly significant. In our businesses as a whole, they're worth considerably more than what we carry them for on our books. But where this gap becomes really dramatic is in our insurance operations. The difference there is what I'd call huge. This is actually one of the key shortcomings of using book value as our measurement tool. However, Charlie and I still believe it's the most useful tracking device we have for measuring changes in intrinsic value, even with these limitations. Think of it as a conservative estimate - we know the true value is higher, particularly in insurance, but book value gives us a consistent, if understated, way to track our progress. That's why we've stuck with it since 1965, even though our market price performance of 22% annually actually looks better than our book value growth of 20.3%. We prefer to use the more conservative measure, even if it doesn't fully capture all the value we've created."

Charlie and I still believe these factors will help us produce better-than-average results over time. But here's the thing you have to understand: huge sums of money create their own anchor. It's like trying to turn a battleship instead of a speedboat. Our future advantage, if we have one at all, will be just a small fraction of what we enjoyed historically. That's not a complaint - it's simply mathematics. When you're managing billions of dollars, you can't dance in and out of positions like you could with millions. The opportunities have to be much larger to move the needle, and those are naturally fewer and farther between."

Look at the auto industry in 1910, aircraft in 1930, or television sets in 1950. Anyone could see these industries would experience fabulous growth - that wasn't the hard part. But here's what many missed: the competitive dynamics in these growing industries absolutely decimated most of the companies that entered them. Even the survivors came away bleeding. You see, dramatic growth in an industry doesn't automatically translate to profits for investors. Charlie and I simply can't judge what profit margins and returns on capital will look like when countless competitors are battling for supremacy. That's why we avoid businesses whose futures we can't evaluate, no matter how exciting their products might be. It's not about finding the next big thing - it's about finding businesses where we can reasonably predict the economic outcome."

You see, at Berkshire, we believe too-big-to-fail is not a fallback position. Instead, we arrange our affairs so that any conceivable cash requirements are dwarfed by our own liquidity. That liquidity isn't static - it's constantly refreshed by earnings from our diverse businesses. Yes, we pay a steep price for this approach. The $20 billion-plus in cash equivalents we typically maintain earns very little in today's environment. But let me tell you how this served us during the 2008 crisis. When the financial system went into cardiac arrest, Berkshire wasn't asking for help - we were providing it. We were able to pour $15.5 billion into the business world when it desperately needed it. $9 billion went to three highly-regarded American businesses that needed our vote of confidence, and $6.5 billion helped fund the Wrigley purchase while panic reigned elsewhere. So while we sacrifice some returns by maintaining such strong liquidity, we sleep well, and more importantly, we're able to be a source of stability when markets are in turmoil."

Charlie and I have learned this lesson the hard way. Even when we can clearly see an industry is going to grow, we often can't judge what the profit margins and returns on capital will be as competitors fight for market share. You've got a host of companies battling for supremacy, and even the survivors tend to come away bleeding. That's why at Berkshire, we stick to a different approach. We focus on businesses whose profit picture we can reasonably predict for decades to come. Now, don't misunderstand me - we'll still make plenty of mistakes even with this conservative approach. But we prefer this predictability over trying to pick winners in highly competitive growth industries. It's about understanding our limitations and staying within our circle of competence. We'd rather have a business with predictable, steady returns than try to navigate an industry where the growth is obvious but the economics are unclear."

Now, does this mean we sometimes catch management problems a bit late? Yes. Do Charlie and I occasionally see decisions made that we might have approached differently? Also yes. But here's the key thing - the benefits far outweigh the costs. Most of our managers use their independence magnificently. They maintain what I call an owner-oriented attitude, which is absolutely invaluable and surprisingly rare in large organizations. You see, we'd much rather accept the visible costs of a few bad decisions than suffer the many invisible costs that come from slow decision-making or paralysis caused by bureaucracy. With 257,000 employees and hundreds of operating units, we could easily become bogged down in committees and endless budget presentations. But that's not the Berkshire way. We operate as a collection of separately-managed businesses, with most decisions happening right at the operating level. Charlie and I stick to what we do best - allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers, and setting compensation. It's a system that's served us well, and we plan to keep it that way."

That's worth something. Second, regarding investors - we make absolutely no effort to woo Wall Street. None. We're not interested in attracting investors who make decisions based on media buzz or analyst commentary. That's just not our game. What we want are partners who come to Berkshire because they understand our business and agree with our policies. They're making a long-term investment decision based on their own analysis and understanding. We're looking for investors who think like owners, not traders. They should be comfortable with our approach of maintaining substantial cash reserves for security and opportunities, even when those reserves aren't generating much current income.

Think about it this way - if we were going into a small business with a few partners, we'd want people who understand the business and agree with how we run it. That fundamental truth doesn't change just because we're operating at a much larger scale. We're not interested in investors who buy and sell based on what some analyst said on TV or what they read in the morning paper. Instead, we want partners who are making a long-term investment in a business they truly understand. To maintain this kind of shareholder base, we believe in direct, informative communication. I always ask myself: What would I want to know if I were the shareholder? That's why we put our financial information out on weekends, giving everyone plenty of time to digest it without the pressure of trading hours.

What happened? Many news organizations just grabbed the first part about economic shambles and completely ignored the critical qualifier about market direction. This illustrates a fundamental challenge we face. Our business and our communications simply don't lend themselves to catchy headlines or sound bites. That's precisely why we put so much effort into direct communication with our shareholders. We need to provide complete context and nuanced explanations, which often require thousands of words to properly convey. These matters can't be adequately summarized in a few paragraphs, and when the media tries to do so, important context often gets lost.

Take our property-casualty insurance business, for example. It's been the real engine behind Berkshire's growth - and we expect it will continue to be. It's worked wonders for us, so much so that we carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more than their net tangible assets in our 'Goodwill' account. By separating our operations into four distinct sectors, we can give shareholders a clearer picture of how each business contributes to Berkshire's overall performance.

In some cases, like with workers' compensation claims, we might not pay out for decades. This collect-now, pay-later model creates what we call 'float' - essentially large sums of money that will eventually go to others but that we can invest for Berkshire's benefit in the meantime. What's particularly wonderful about our float is its stability relative to premium volume. As we grow our insurance business, our float grows too. Now, here's where it gets really interesting: if we can achieve an underwriting profit - meaning our premiums exceed our total expenses and eventual losses - we're essentially being paid to hold and invest other people's money. It's like having free money to invest, and sometimes even better than free because we're getting paid to hold it. Of course, this attractive model draws intense competition, which is why many insurers operate at an underwriting loss. They're effectively paying for the privilege of holding their float. But at Berkshire, we've built what I believe is the best large insurance operation in the world, and it has worked wonders for us."

On our books, we carry our P/C companies at $15.5 billion more than their net tangible assets in our 'Goodwill' account, but they're worth far more than that carrying value. Here's why: The industry has two potential sources of profit - underwriting and investments. When premiums exceed expenses and eventual losses, you get an underwriting profit. This adds to whatever investment income you generate from the float. That's the ideal scenario. However - and this is crucial - this appealing model attracts intense competition. The competition is so vigorous that in most years, the P/C industry as a whole operates at a significant underwriting loss. Think of this loss as the price the industry pays to hold its float. In normal years, this cost stays relatively low. But when catastrophes hit, the underwriting losses can more than wipe out any investment income from the float. It's a delicate balance - the potential for 'free money' draws in competitors, which then drives down pricing and profitability. That's why building a sustainable competitive advantage, like we've done at Berkshire, is so critical in this business."

Float is essentially like having someone deposit money with us that we can invest, but unlike a bank, we don't have to pay interest on it. We've grown our float from a modest $16 million in 1967 to $62 billion in 2009, which is remarkable. What makes our float truly special is that we've managed to operate at an underwriting profit for seven consecutive years. This means we're actually getting paid to hold and invest this money, rather than paying for the privilege. Now, this isn't normal in the property-casualty insurance industry - most companies actually lose money on their underwriting, which means their float has a cost. But at Berkshire, we've created something extraordinary through our outstanding managers running unusual businesses. Think of it this way: it's like having a $62 billion interest-free loan that, in most years, someone actually pays us to take. That's the magic of our insurance operations, though I should emphasize this isn't typical for the industry as a whole."

At Berkshire, we've managed to be different for one primary reason: our outstanding managers running unusual businesses. We have what I believe to be the best large insurance operation in the world, and I can state without any doubt that we have the best managers. Take GEICO, for instance, which is run by Tony Nicely who started there at age 18. They're so effective at what they do that they can spend $800 million annually on advertising - nearly double their closest competitor in auto insurance - and still maintain profitability. The key difference is that our insurance CEOs have added many billions of dollars to Berkshire's value by operating with outstanding economics, while most of the industry struggles with inadequate premiums.

But here's where I made a classic mistake - I didn't listen to the people who knew better. Our GEICO managers tried to warn me that instead of getting the cream of our customer base, we'd get what I'll politely call the non-cream. I was, as I said, older but certainly not wiser. The results? We lost $6.3 million in pre-tax losses from operations, and then had to sell our troubled receivables portfolio at 55 cents on the dollar, losing another $44 million.

In the early days, Charlie and I actually avoided capital-intensive businesses like public utilities. We were very focused - and still are - on businesses that have high returns on capital and need very little incremental investment to grow. Those are still the best businesses by far for owners. But here's the reality we face today: Berkshire is generating ever-increasing amounts of cash, and we need to put that money to work. So we've adapted our approach. We're now quite willing to enter businesses that require large capital expenditures, but - and this is important - we have one key criterion: these businesses must have reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental capital they invest. We're not looking for spectacular returns in these cases, but we do need to see a clear path to above-average returns over the long term. Think about our BNSF railroad or our utility operations. These businesses require heavy investment above depreciation allowances, but they provide essential services that will always be needed, and they have predictable regulatory frameworks that allow us to earn fair returns on our capital. That's the kind of capital-intensive business we're willing to own now."

They're critical not just to their immediate customers, but to the entire economic well-being of communities and the nation as a whole. You can't run a modern economy without railroads or electricity. Second, both businesses share a similar investment profile. They require very heavy investment that goes well beyond depreciation allowances, and this isn't just for a year or two - we're talking about decades of sustained investment. Third, and this is crucial, both businesses require long-term planning. We have to look way ahead and anticipate demand that will be larger than anything we've seen in the past. You can't wait until the demand shows up to start building infrastructure. Finally, both businesses operate within regulatory frameworks that need to provide certainty about allowable returns. This regulatory certainty is absolutely essential because without it, we couldn't justify making the huge investments required to maintain, replace, and expand these operations. When you have these characteristics together - essential services, predictable regulation, and the ability to earn fair returns on major capital investments - you've got the kind of business we're very comfortable owning for the long term."

But here's the key point - both require a stable regulatory environment with predictable returns to justify the massive capital investments we need to make. You see, we can't make these huge investments without confidence in the regulatory framework. That's why I talk about the 'social compact' between these businesses and the public. It's a two-way street - we provide essential services and maintain critical infrastructure, and in return, we need fair, consistent regulation that allows us to earn reasonable returns. Both businesses also use substantial amounts of debt not guaranteed by Berkshire, retain most earnings, and continue investing through good times and bad. Though the railroad shows more cyclicality, both sectors are fundamental to America's economic potential. That's why we're willing to invest tens of billions of incremental equity capital - we see them as similar businesses with strong long-term economics when properly regulated."

We invest enormous sums of money to ensure reliable service. In return, we need regulators who understand that we require predictable, reasonable returns to justify these massive investments. If either side fails to live up to their end of the bargain, everyone loses. The railroad can't function properly without adequate investment, and we can't make those investments without appropriate returns. It's simply inconceivable that our country could achieve its full economic potential without first-class electricity and railroad systems. That's why this compact is so vital - it's not just about Berkshire's interests, it's about America's economic future. Both parties need to recognize that good behavior encourages good behavior from the other side.

The market chose that third option, which was the most sensible approach. By dropping to 554,000 starts - the lowest in 50 years - we were finally allowing the excess inventory to clear.

I particularly noticed that many families who were priced out of the market during the bubble years suddenly found homes were within their reach. It's important to remember that while prices remained well below those bubble levels, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing for the overall market. Think of it as a reset to more realistic valuations. The exception to this recovery was in two specific areas: very high-value houses and certain locations where the overbuilding was particularly excessive.

The problem is that many investors do exactly the opposite - they only invest when commentators are upbeat, and they end up paying a heavy price for that meaningless reassurance.

I've always believed that if Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be my fault - not because of some Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer making poor decisions. You see, when you're dealing with derivatives, which can be like dynamite in terms of risk, you need the person at the top taking direct responsibility. That's why I believe any board overseeing a major financial institution is being derelict in its duties if it doesn't insist that its CEO bear full responsibility for risk control. And let me add this - if a CEO isn't capable of handling that job, well, they should be looking for different employment.

You see, the real dangers of derivatives - and we've been warning about these for years - come from two things: extreme leverage and counterparty risk. At Berkshire, we've made absolutely certain that neither of these issues exists in our derivative positions. We've actually benefited significantly from the float these contracts provide, and we expect to earn additional investment income over their lifetime. We're very transparent about this - we separate out these figures in our reporting, just like we do with realized investment gains and losses, so our shareholders can clearly see the earnings from our operating businesses.

When these institutions fail and the government has to step in with guarantees or funding, the consequences for these CEOs have been far too light. Look at what happened in just the four largest financial disasters of recent years - shareholders lost over $500 billion, with most seeing 90% or more of their investment wiped out. But the CEOs? They're still living quite comfortably. This has to change. We need real consequences - what I call 'meaningful sticks' to go along with those oversized financial carrots they've been enjoying.

The real issue here is that the wrong people paid the price. The shareholders, who weren't the ones making these reckless decisions, lost nearly everything. Meanwhile, the CEOs and directors who actually caused these disasters came through relatively unscathed. Sure, their fortunes may have been diminished, but they're still living in grand style.

If the CEO of Company A offers 1¼ shares of A for each share of B, they might think they're making a fair deal because B is worth $100 per share. But here's the problem: the shareholders of the target company B are naturally going to focus on the market price of the acquirer's shares they're receiving. They also expect - and rightfully so - to receive the intrinsic value of their own shares they're giving up. When you're using undervalued stock as currency, you're essentially overpaying because you have to issue more shares to make up for the price discount.

What's particularly troubling is that the CEO might get away with this because they can correctly say they're offering a premium to the market price. But remember, they're destroying shareholder value. The warning signs to watch for are serial acquirers using their stock as currency, especially during market bubbles. We saw this behavior reach truly obscene levels in the late 1960s, where some companies were essentially using what I'd call 'counterfeit money' - their overvalued stock - to buy real assets. There's usually plenty of private snickering about these deals, but you won't hear anyone involved publicly acknowledge what's really happening.

So while shareholders might suffer from a poor deal, the CEO gets to expand their empire. It's a situation where the incentives aren't properly aligned. When we made the BNSF acquisition, Charlie and I were very conscious of this dynamic. We used our shares for 40% of the purchase price, but only because we believed our shares were worth more than their market value at the time. We were effectively giving away more value than the market recognized, but we did this knowingly and believed it was the right thing for our shareholders. This is quite different from cases where CEOs use overvalued stock simply because they can, without regard for the true cost to their shareholders.

The size of the mistake doesn't make it any less of a mistake. In this case, we watched a perfectly good bank overpay by about three times book value for a smaller bank, simply to show they were active in the market. The seller was smart - he even made them promise never to do another deal that dumb before he'd agree to it! The end result?

We had wonderful parents who made sure we got good educations - that's a form of luck many don't have. We've enjoyed great health and supportive families, which shouldn't be taken for granted. But here's the key point - we were also born with what I call a 'business gene' that allows us to prosper far beyond what many equally or more valuable contributors to society experience. This isn't just about working hard - though we do - it's about having a natural aptitude that happens to be highly rewarded in our economic system. When people ask about success in business, I think it's crucial to recognize both the role of inherent advantages and the disproportionate rewards certain talents receive in our society. It's not just about merit - it's about being lucky enough to have the right capabilities in the right place at the right time."

We have jobs we love so much that, if pushed, we'd actually pay substantial sums to keep doing them (though I always add - don't tell that to the Compensation Committee!). The work has only become more fascinating over the years, not less. This enthusiasm is multiplied by being surrounded by talented and cheerful associates who help us in countless ways. I believe this kind of genuine passion for your work is invaluable. It's why our annual meeting - what we call our 'Woodstock for Capitalists' - is such a joy for us. Nothing is more fun than getting together with our shareholder-partners. When you truly love what you do, it doesn't feel like work in the conventional sense. At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain as excited about our jobs as ever. That sustained enthusiasm, that genuine love for the work, is a crucial component of long-term success and satisfaction in any career."
