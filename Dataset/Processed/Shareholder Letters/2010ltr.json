Now, we know the movement of goods in the United States will increase over time. That's not speculation, that's mathematics. At BNSF, we're positioned to get our full share of that growth, but it requires massive investment. Here's the key point - Berkshire is uniquely positioned to make those investments. Last year alone, we put $6 billion into property and equipment, with 90% of that - $5.4 billion - right here in America. And we're not stopping there. We're setting a new record of $8 billion in capital spending this year. Look, some folks get nervous about big investments during uncertain times, but our checks will clear regardless of how slow the economy is or how chaotic the markets get. That's the Berkshire advantage. Money flows toward opportunity, and America has that in abundance. While others hesitate, we're doubling down on American infrastructure because we understand that the American system for unleashing human potential remains incredibly effective, just as it has been for over two centuries."

But here's the reality check: our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than when I was born. That's not theory, that's fact. Think about some truly uncertain times - December 6, 1941, October 18, 1987, and September 10, 2001. Each of these dates preceded enormous challenges, yet America powered through. The key is that the prophets of doom consistently overlook what I consider the all-important factor that is certain: human potential is far from exhausted. The American system for unleashing that potential has worked wonders for over two centuries, despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War. Yes, tomorrow is always uncertain - that's just the nature of things. But don't let that reality spook you. What matters isn't the uncertainty - which is constant - but rather the remarkable resilience of the American system and its ability to unleash human potential. That's what has consistently proven the pessimists wrong, and it's why I remain fundamentally optimistic about America's future."

What makes America special is our system for unleashing human potential. Look, we've faced plenty of obstacles - recessions, the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War II - but our system has worked wonders for over two centuries. The prophets of doom keep missing the key point: human potential is far from exhausted. When I look around today, I see a world that would have been beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Just as America showed its resilience in 1776, 1861, 1932, and 1941, I'm convinced our best days still lie ahead. The American system remains alive and effective at creating progress, even when we face temporary setbacks."

Without these standards, there's a real temptation for management to shoot the arrow first and then paint the bull's-eye around wherever it lands. At Berkshire, we've set a straightforward benchmark: our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate that beats the S&P 500 (including dividends). Some years we hit this target, other years we miss it. But here's the crucial point - if we can't achieve this goal over time, we've failed our investors, who could have gotten the same or better results simply by owning an index fund. Now, calculating intrinsic value is tricky. If you ask Charlie and me separately, you'll get different answers - precision just isn't possible. That's why we use book value as our proxy for intrinsic value when measuring performance. It's understated, but it helps eliminate subjectivity. We believe this gives our investors a clear, albeit conservative, way to judge our results."

Now, I'll be the first to tell you that this isn't a perfect system - some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying value on our books. But here's the key thing: since that premium doesn't usually swing wildly from year to year, book value serves as a reasonable device for tracking how we're doing. It's like having a yardstick that might be off by a few inches - not perfect, but if you use it consistently, you can still measure progress pretty well. The important thing is to have a consistent, objective measure that we can use to gauge our performance against the S&P 500 over long periods. We've been doing this for 46 years now, and while it may not capture every nuance of our businesses' true value, it gives our shareholders a reliable way to evaluate how we're doing."

Let me give you a concrete example from our own operations. At GEICO, we spent $900 million last year on advertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. And you know what? If we could spend twice that amount productively, we would happily do so, even though it would hurt our short-term results even more. The same principle applies to our railroad and utility operations, where we regularly make large investments with an eye to payoffs well down the road. That's why we provide five-year performance periods in our reports - to give our shareholders a longer-term perspective on our performance. This isn't about quarter-to-quarter thinking; it's about making the right decisions that will pay off over time, even if they might penalize our short-term results."

And I'm happy to tell you that this strategy has paid off remarkably well. Just look at the numbers - our non-insurance businesses' pre-tax earnings per share grew from $2.87 in 1970 to $5,926.04 in 2010. That's a compound annual growth rate of 21.0% over forty years. What's particularly interesting is how consistent this growth has been - we saw rates of 20.8% in the 1970s, 18.4% in the 1980s, 24.5% in the 1990s, and 20.5% in the 2000s. This steady growth in operating earnings has been a major driver of value creation for Berkshire, and it's reflected in our stock price, which increased at 22.1% annually during this period. This is exactly the kind of long-term, sustainable growth we aim for at Berkshire."

First, you need to understand that market price and intrinsic value don't always walk hand in hand - in fact, they often take very different paths, sometimes for quite a while. But here's the key thing: they eventually meet up. It's like two people walking through a park - they might take different routes, but they'll end up at the same destination. Now, when we think about intrinsic value, there's this important third element that's more subjective: how effectively retained earnings will be deployed in the future. Over the next decade, we - and many other businesses - will likely retain earnings that equal or exceed our current capital. But here's where it gets interesting - some companies will take those retained dollars and turn them into fifty-cent pieces, while others will turn them into two-dollar bills. That's why we focus so intensely on ensuring our retained earnings are deployed effectively. And you can see this in our results - our stock price has moved in rough tandem with our investments and earnings over time, which is exactly what you should expect when retained earnings are put to good use."

You see, when we look at a business, we're not just looking at what they have now - we have to evaluate what they're going to do with the money they make in the future. Most successful businesses are going to retain significant earnings over the next decade. The key question is: what will management do with those retained dollars? Some management teams will take a dollar and turn it into fifty cents - that's obviously not what we want. Others will take that same dollar and turn it into two dollars - that's the kind of management we're looking for. Just look at the stark contrast between Sears Roebuck and Sam Walton in the late 1960s. A dollar in Sam Walton's hands had a completely different destiny than a dollar in the hands of Sears' management. If we believe a CEO has both the talent and the right motivations to reinvest effectively, that adds tremendous value to the company today. But if we're suspicious of either their abilities or their motives, we have to discount the current value significantly. The difference in outcomes can be huge, and as outside investors, we're essentially helpless once management has our money. That's why this evaluation is so crucial before we invest."

Second, we need more major acquisitions - that's why I say our elephant gun has been reloaded and my trigger finger is itchy. But we do have some important advantages that help offset the challenge of our size. One of our biggest advantages is our exceptional group of managers. We've got truly skilled operators who are unusually committed to both their individual businesses and to Berkshire as a whole. What's particularly special is that many of our CEOs are already independently wealthy - they're not working because they have to, they're working because they love what they do. That kind of passionate, skilled management is invaluable when you're trying to grow a large enterprise.

That's what I mean by volunteers rather than mercenaries. You see, we give them an environment that's unique in corporate America. They don't have to deal with endless headquarters meetings, they don't have financing worries, and they're completely sheltered from Wall Street harassment. I just send them a letter every couple of years, and they call me when they want to. Some I might not talk to for a year; others I speak with almost daily. It's their choice. We trust in people rather than process - that's fundamental to how we operate. I like to say we have a 'hire well, manage little' approach. And it works beautifully. Our managers come in all shapes and sizes - some have MBAs, others never finished college. Some are budget-focused, others operate by instinct. It's like having a baseball team of all-stars, each with their own unique batting style.

But here's the problem with that approach: you're artificially constraining yourself to what might be a very tiny universe of opportunities, and often these opportunities aren't particularly attractive. Think about it - when you're competing with every other company in your industry for the same limited set of investment opportunities, what happens? The competition becomes fierce, and the returns often suffer. At Berkshire, we do something different. After we've met the needs of our existing businesses, we typically have substantial sums left over. Instead of forcing these funds into a narrow channel, we look at the wider world of opportunities. This gives us a tremendous advantage because we can allocate capital wherever we find the best returns, regardless of industry or sector. It's like having a much larger fishing pond than everyone else. We're not forced to fish in a small pond just because that's where we started. This flexibility in capital allocation has been one of our key advantages over the years."

That's exactly what happens in restricted investment universes - the sellers gain tremendous pricing power. At Berkshire, we don't face those institutional restraints. The only real limitation Charlie and I have is our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. Once we clear that hurdle - and believe me, there are plenty of times we can't - we can compare any opportunity against numerous others. This gives us a tremendous advantage in finding value. We can look across industries, across asset classes, and make decisions based purely on where we see the best returns. That's a luxury many institutions simply don't have, and it's been a crucial factor in our long-term success."

Now, here's where I really showed my early 'wisdom' - I did exactly the wrong thing. Instead of recognizing the fundamental problems in the textile business, I kept trying to find opportunities to improve and expand the existing textile operation. And then, in what I sarcastically call my 'final burst of brilliance,' I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh! This experience taught me a crucial lesson about capital allocation. Eventually, I came to my senses and began diversifying into insurance and other industries. The key learning here was that it's not enough to try to improve a fundamentally challenged business - you need to be willing to look at the wider world of opportunities. Today, we measure potential business acquisitions not just against other businesses, but also against opportunities in marketable securities, something many managers don't do. This broader perspective helps us avoid overpaying for businesses when better returns are available elsewhere."

We're constantly comparing one business against many others. But here's what's really unique - we also measure business opportunities against what's available in marketable securities, which most management teams don't do. When we see businesses priced too high compared to potential returns from stocks and bonds, we're perfectly happy to buy securities and wait patiently. Let me give you a concrete example. Look at See's Candies and Business Wire - both are wonderfully run businesses, but they have limited reinvestment opportunities. Instead of forcing capital into these businesses, we can take the earnings they generate and use that money for other opportunities, like we did when we bought BNSF. This flexibility in moving capital around to wherever it can earn the best returns has been crucial to our success over the years. We're not locked into any single industry or investment type, and that's a tremendous advantage."

We don't even provide them with directors and officers liability insurance, which is almost unheard of at large public companies. Why? Because we want them to have real skin in the game. If they make mistakes with your money, they lose their own too. In fact, excluding my holdings, our directors and their families own more than $3 billion worth of Berkshire shares. This ownership mentality extends to our managers too. Many of them came to us as owners of family businesses they'd run for generations. They sought us out specifically because they understood and appreciated our approach. This owner-orientation throughout the organization - from the board room to the management offices - creates a culture that's very hard to duplicate.

Look at our headquarters - we spend just $270,212 on annual rent and have only $301,363 invested in all our office furniture and equipment. When Charlie and I treat shareholders' money as if it's our own, it sets the tone for everyone else. We back this up with carefully designed compensation programs, our annual meeting format, and even how we write our annual reports.

When you have managers who truly love their businesses, that's no small advantage. They don't need us looking over their shoulders because they care deeply about their operations. We reinforce this by creating an environment that encourages them to maintain that owner's mindset. We avoid the bureaucratic procedures that tend to beget more bureaucracy, and we stay away from the imperial corporate palaces that induce imperious behavior. As long as Charlie and I continue treating shareholders' money as if it were our own, our managers will do the same.

Now, here's the wonderful part - while we're holding this float, we get to invest it for Berkshire's benefit. And it's not small change we're talking about. Our float has grown remarkably over the years, from just $39 million in 1970 to over $65 billion by 2010. What makes this even better is that when we achieve an underwriting profit - meaning our premiums exceed our total expenses and losses - we're essentially being paid to hold this money that we can invest.

This extraordinary growth isn't just about bigger numbers - it reflects something fundamental about our business model. You see, our float remains remarkably stable in relation to our premium volume, which means as our insurance business grows, our float grows with it. This stability is crucial because it allows us to make long-term investment decisions with this money. What's particularly important to understand is that this isn't just about collecting premiums - it's about maintaining discipline in our underwriting. When we achieve an underwriting profit, this float essentially becomes free money for us to invest, and we even get paid for holding it.

But here's the catch - and it's a big one - every insurance company wants this, and that creates intense competition. This competition is so fierce that most insurance companies actually operate at an underwriting loss. Take State Farm, for example. They're the largest insurer in the country and well-managed, but they've had underwriting losses in seven of the last ten years - more than $20 billion in total. That loss is essentially what they're paying for the privilege of holding their float. At Berkshire, we've managed to be different. We've had eight consecutive years of underwriting profits, totaling $17 billion. But I want to emphasize - this is not normal for the P/C industry. Most insurance companies have premiums that don't cover their claims and expenses. That's why the industry's return on tangible equity has consistently underperformed compared to American industry as a whole, and I expect that pattern to continue."

Think about that - we're getting paid to hold money that we can then invest. Most insurers can't say that. The typical scenario in the P/C industry is quite different. The intense competition leads companies to price their policies too low, resulting in premiums that don't cover claims plus expenses. That's why you see companies like State Farm, despite being well-managed, posting significant underwriting losses. While we can't guarantee we'll always have underwriting profits - there will certainly be some bad years - I believe we'll continue to be profitable in most future years. This approach has helped us avoid the industry's chronic problem of generating returns that fall far short of the average American industry. It's a fundamental difference in how we view and manage the insurance business."

First, you need to thoroughly understand all the exposures that could cause a policy to incur losses. Second, you must conservatively evaluate how likely those exposures are to actually cause a loss and what it might cost. Third, you've got to set premiums that will deliver a profit after covering both expected losses and operating expenses. But here's the kicker - the fourth discipline is having the willingness to walk away if you can't get the right premium. And let me tell you, this is where many insurers stumble. They might master the first three, but they flunk this critical fourth test. You see, there's enormous pressure from Wall Street, from agents and brokers, and sometimes just plain ego from CEOs who can't stand to see their volume shrink. They fall into the trap of thinking 'well, the other guy is doing it, so we must too.' That's a dangerous way of thinking in any business, but it's absolutely poisonous in insurance. You simply can't write business at inadequate prices and expect to succeed long-term."

When I say better than cost-free, I mean we're actually making money on the float rather than paying to hold it. That's not easy to do in this business. And what's even better is that we expect this performance to continue, on average, going forward. Tad has shown tremendous discipline in not chasing business at inadequate prices, which is exactly what we want to see. He understands that it's better to turn down business than to write it at prices that don't make sense. This disciplined approach has consistently delivered the kind of results we look for in our insurance operations."

Now, here's the key point: we can't just sit back and wait for problems to develop. We have to anticipate what society will need and invest accordingly. That's why we spend far more than our depreciation - $2 billion more in 2011 alone. The same principle applies at MidAmerican. When you're providing electricity to 2.4 million customers and transporting 8% of the country's natural gas, you've got to stay ahead of the curve. It's what I call a social compact - we invest heavily in infrastructure, operate efficiently, and in return, we earn fair returns on those investments.

And our other pipeline, Kern River, actually took the top spot. That's not just a minor improvement - that's going from worst to first. This transformation happened because we understand that reliable, efficient operations benefit both our customers and our shareholders. We're serving millions of Americans every day through our electric business and natural gas pipelines, and we've delivered outstanding results for both our owners - remember, Berkshire owns 89.8% - and our customers.

When you're eating your own cooking, as we were, it tends to concentrate the mind wonderfully. Our loss rates stayed pretty reasonable - between 1.17% and 1.86% even during the tough years of 2006-2010. Now, our borrowers did face challenges when they lost jobs or had health problems or divorces - that's just life. The recession hit them hard. But because they'd borrowed sensible amounts relative to their income and had skin in the game through their down payments, they generally wanted to and were able to stay in their homes. I've always said that if home buyers across America had followed these same principles, we wouldn't have had the crisis we did.

This illustrates an important point about opportunity costs that I think many people miss. Still, a home purchase can be a sound decision when approached sensibly. The key is to think of it primarily as a place to live that can also be a reasonable investment, not as a way to get rich quick. When people buy homes they can actually afford, with reasonable down payments and monthly payments that make sense relative to their income - like we required at Clayton - they're much more likely to be successful homeowners over the long term. It's when folks start thinking of their houses as speculative investments or ATM machines that they get into trouble. The basic principle here is the same one we applied in our lending - be sensible about what you can afford and think long-term."

Those were my two best investments, and I say that with a smile.

Look at what's happened in the hedge fund world - you've got partners who make huge money on the upside and then walk away rich when things go south, leaving their limited partners holding the bag. That's why with our managers like Todd and Lou, we set up arrangements with deferrals and carryforwards. This prevents what I call 'see-saw performance' from generating undeserved payments.

When we found Todd Combs, we knew we had our match. He understood our philosophy and met our requirements. Just like with Lou, who's been one of the investment greats - and I don't say that lightly - we needed someone who could maintain our investment principles for the long term. Lou never advertised his talents, but his record speaks for itself - in fact, I stopped updating his equity performance in our reports because it made mine look bad!

That's why we've put specific arrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards at Berkshire. When we bring on investment managers like Todd, we structure their compensation so that about 80% depends on their own portfolio performance and 20% on other managers' performance. This approach does two important things: it rewards individual success substantially, but it also encourages cooperation rather than competition. We want our managers working together, not against each other. And importantly, we have safeguards to prevent undeserved payments from see-saw performance.

Take Todd's role for example - while he's primarily focused on equities, he's not restricted to that form of investment. He has the flexibility to manage between one to three billion dollars, adjusting annually, and can invest where he sees the best opportunities. As for the future, I'm still managing the great majority of Berkshire's holdings, both bonds and equities, while I'm CEO. But we're thinking ahead.

Our net income would only show that loss, making it look smaller than our operating income. Or think about this - if we really wanted to boost net income, we could simply realize some gains from our huge stockpile of unrealized gains. We have plenty to choose from. That's why focusing on net income can give you a very distorted picture of how our businesses are actually performing.

You see, regulators and auditors love Black-Scholes because it gives them a precise number, even if we believe that number isn't really meaningful for long-term options.

When security prices rose in the next quarter, that theoretical liability actually decreased to $5.8 billion by September 30th.

But here's where it gets interesting - the Black-Scholes formula actually required us to increase our balance-sheet liability from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion during this same period.

But leverage is like a powerful drug - it's addictive. Once people see those magnified returns, very few have the discipline to go back to more conservative practices. The fundamental problem is what we all learned in third grade mathematics - any series of positive numbers, no matter how impressive they might look, becomes zero when multiplied by a single zero. And leverage, history shows us, has a nasty habit of producing zeros, even when very smart people are using it. That's why at Berkshire, we follow the fundamental principle I borrowed from auto racing: to finish first, you must first finish. We're focused on staying in the game for the long term, and excessive leverage can take you out of it in a heartbeat."

But when it's missing, it's the only thing anybody can think about. Let me explain why this matters so much. Many companies operate under the assumption that their debt obligations can simply be refinanced as they mature. Most of the time, they're right about that. But here's the catch - occasionally, either because of problems specific to the company or a broader credit crisis in the market, those maturities actually have to be met with real cash payments. And in those moments, only cash will do - you can't pay your debts with promises or good intentions. We saw this play out dramatically in September 2008, when the overnight disappearance of credit in many sectors nearly brought our entire country to its knees. Even a brief absence of credit can bring a company down completely. That's why at Berkshire, we maintain such a conservative approach to leverage and always ensure we have ample cash reserves. We never want to be in a position where we're dependent on the kindness of strangers or the perfect functioning of credit markets to survive."

When you have that kind of responsibility, you simply can't afford to play games with risk. I witnessed firsthand in September 2008 how the overnight disappearance of credit in many sectors nearly brought our entire country to its knees. Even a brief interruption in credit can devastate a company. At our age - Charlie and I have a combined age of 167 - we have absolutely no interest in any activity that could pose even the slightest threat to Berkshire's well-being. Starting over isn't on our bucket list, as we like to say. It would be completely irresponsible for us to risk what all these constituencies need just to chase a few extra points of return."

But that early experience working for my grandfather Ernest was formative for both of us. Nobody - and I mean nobody - worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped by the experience. This kind of early business education, learning the fundamentals of responsible management and the importance of trust, stays with you. It's part of why we maintain such a disciplined approach at Berkshire today. These early lessons about responsibility and prudent management became core principles in how we run Berkshire Hathaway."

He insisted each of his children keep $1,000 in cash - which I discovered firsthand when I found my Aunt Alice's letter and cash in her safe deposit box years later. At Berkshire, we've taken that basic principle and scaled it up considerably. We maintain at least $10 billion in cash as our absolute minimum, though we typically keep around $20 billion on hand. This serves two crucial purposes: First, it lets us handle major insurance losses like the $3 billion hit we took from Katrina. Second, it gives us the ability to move quickly when opportunities arise, even during market turmoil. You see, having liquidity isn't just about surviving - it's about being able to act decisively when others can't. Ernest understood this at a family level, and we've applied it at Berkshire on a much larger scale. It's a simple principle, but it's kept us solid through all kinds of economic weather."

But as Ray DeVoe wisely noted, 'More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.' That's a principle we believed in long before the weaknesses in commercial paper and money markets became obvious to everyone in 2008. We also maintain a strong position by avoiding bank lines and steering clear of contracts that might require us to post significant collateral. You see, when you're managing money, it's not just about what you might gain - it's about what you absolutely can't afford to lose. Those few extra basis points of yield aren't worth compromising our fundamental liquidity position. It's another example of how we prefer simple, conservative approaches that let us sleep at night and keep us ready for opportunities or challenges when they arise."

Sure, this conservative approach might penalize our returns slightly, but it lets us sleep well at night. More importantly, it gives us the ability to act decisively when others can't. Look at what happened during the 2008 financial crisis after Lehman's bankruptcy - we were able to invest $15.6 billion in just 25 days while others were scrambling for survival. That's the real value of our approach. We've built our financial strength consistently over 40 years, retaining all earnings - about $1 billion per month now - rather than paying dividends or doing share repurchases. This has grown our net worth from $48 million to $157 billion, and our intrinsic value has increased even more. No other American corporation has built financial strength this way. It's not just about having the financial capacity; it's about having the emotional readiness to play offense when others are in chaos."

Instead, we've taken a different path that I believe has served our shareholders exceptionally well. We've retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, which now adds up to about $1 billion per month in reinforcement to our operations. The results speak for themselves: our net worth has grown from $48 million to $157 billion during those four decades, and our intrinsic value has increased even more substantially than that. This is a unique approach - no other American corporation has come close to building up its financial strength in this unrelenting way. This strategy gives us tremendous flexibility and staying power. When opportunities arise, particularly during times of market stress or panic, we have the financial ammunition ready to act. It's like having a loaded elephant gun ready when big game appears. This approach might seem overly conservative to some, but it's precisely this financial strength that allows us to make bold moves when others are paralyzed by fear or lack of capital. The proof was in the pudding during the 2008 crisis when we could deploy $15.6 billion in just 25 days after Lehman's collapse."

I tell our managers to measure every action against this standard: would you be happy to see it written about on the front page of a national newspaper by an unfriendly but intelligent reporter? That's a pretty good litmus test. And here's something important - we don't just measure against what's legally permissible. We measure against what's right. I've found there's plenty of money to be made in the center of the court, so to speak. You don't need to play close to the lines. In fact, if you're questioning whether something is too close to the line, my advice is simple: just assume it's outside and forget it.

I tell our managers to try using that explanation with a reporter or a judge and see how far it gets them - it won't get very far at all. If you find yourself hesitating about the propriety or legality of an action, that's usually a red flag. While I'm always available for a call if someone needs guidance, my experience shows that if something causes you to hesitate, it's probably too close to the line and should be abandoned. Remember what I said about playing in the center of the court - there's plenty of good, ethical business to be done there without venturing into the grey areas.

But what really matters is how we respond to even the slightest hint of impropriety. I'll tell you what happened at Salomon - a relatively small problem turned into something that nearly destroyed an 8,000-person firm, simply because people were reluctant to face up to bad news quickly. That's why I always tell our managers: bring me bad news immediately. I can handle it, but I can't handle it after it festers. The key is creating a culture where people know to stay well within ethical boundaries - what I call playing in the center of the court - and where they understand that rapid response to problems is essential. Your behavior as a leader, more than any written policies, will determine how your organization's culture develops around these issues."

I've seen too many situations where trying to operate in that gray area leads to real trouble. Take it from someone who's seen what happened at Salomon - what starts as a borderline decision can quickly spiral into something that threatens an entire enterprise. That's why I tell our managers to stay well away from anything questionable. There's simply no upside in trying to push ethical boundaries when there are so many clearly acceptable ways to be successful in business. And if you do encounter something problematic, don't let it fester - bring it forward immediately. Bad news is manageable; hidden bad news is what kills you."
