The primary job of any Board of Directors is making sure the right people are running the business and that the next generation of leaders is ready to take over. I've sat on 19 corporate boards in my time, and I can tell you that Berkshire's directors have been absolutely outstanding in their approach to succession planning. They've put in the time and diligence, and it's paid off. We've brought on Todd Combs and Ted Weschler as investment managers - both exceptional individuals with outstanding investment skills and a deep commitment to Berkshire. They'll each handle a few billion dollars in 2012, but more importantly, they have the brains, judgment and character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer here. On the CEO front, we have an individual the Board knows well and admires greatly, plus two superb back-up candidates. The transition will be seamless when it happens, and Berkshire's prospects will remain bright. I wouldn't have over 98% of my net worth in Berkshire stock if I wasn't completely confident in the quality of our succession planning and the caliber of people we have in place."

But I'm completely comfortable with this arrangement for several key reasons. First, I know the quality and diversity of the businesses we own at Berkshire - this isn't just a single business we're talking about, but rather a collection of outstanding operations. Second, and just as importantly, I know the caliber of the people who manage these businesses. These factors give me great confidence in Berkshire's future prospects. I should mention that all of this stock will eventually go to various philanthropies, but that doesn't change my thinking about the concentration. When you combine great businesses with great managers, and you have a succession plan that ensures the next generation of leadership is ready to take over, you've got something special. That's what we have at Berkshire. My successor will have a running start thanks to these assets, and that's why I sleep well at night with such a concentrated position."

If gas prices stay where they are, we could lose virtually our entire carrying value. Now, could we recoup some or all of it if gas prices increase substantially? Sure. But that doesn't change the fact that I made a serious miscalculation in my initial assessment. Similarly, I was dead wrong about the housing recovery timeline when I predicted it would begin within a year or so. The numbers tell the story - our housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011, way down from $1.8 billion in 2006. Being wrong is part of investing, but acknowledging these errors openly helps us learn and helps our shareholders understand our decision-making process, both good and bad."

Now, we're well-positioned to benefit when this recovery happens through our five housing-related businesses. Clayton Homes is the largest producer of homes in the country, making about 7% of all homes constructed in 2011. Then we have Acme Brick, Shaw for carpets, Johns Manville for insulation, and MiTek for building products. These businesses are currently operating well below their potential - they made $513 million in pre-tax profits in 2011, similar to 2010, but that's less than a third of what they made in 2006 when they hit $1.8 billion. While I was clearly wrong about the timing of the recovery, the long-term fundamentals haven't changed. Population growth and household formation will eventually drive a housing recovery - it's not a question of if, but when."

Over time, the number of housing units has to match the number of households, allowing for normal vacancy rates. That's just how it works. Now, what happened before 2008 was we got ahead of ourselves. We were building more houses than we had households to fill them, and that bubble had to pop - and pop it did, with consequences that rattled through the whole economy. But here's the key thing I want you to understand: this isn't a permanent condition. Every single day, we're now creating more households than housing units. You see, people might delay setting up households during tough times, but as I like to say, eventually hormones take over. Sure, some folks might double up with family during a recession - but trust me, living with the in-laws gets old pretty quick. With our current pace of just 600,000 housing starts annually, which is well below new household formation, we're steadily absorbing that old oversupply. It's a fundamental reality that can't be ignored, even if the timing varies by location."

Look at our own housing-related companies - they're currently employing only 43,315 people, down from 58,769 in 2006. That's a significant drop. But the real story is bigger than just those numbers. The housing sector includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it. Right now, this sector remains in its own private depression, and I believe this is the primary reason we've seen such a lag in employment recovery, even while other sectors of our economy have made substantial comebacks. When housing suffers, it creates a ripple effect through the entire economy. Think about it - when housing is down, it's not just the construction workers who are affected. It's the carpet makers, the appliance manufacturers, the furniture stores, and countless other related businesses. That's why I see housing as the major roadblock to a full employment recovery. While other parts of our economy have bounced back steadily, this crucial sector continues to sputter, and we feel those effects across the board."

It's really quite simple: if we outperform the S&P 500 over time, we've earned our keep. If we don't, we're overpaid no matter what you're paying us. Now, here's the tricky part - we can't precisely calculate intrinsic value. It's like trying to measure love - you know it's there, but you can't put an exact number on it. However, we do have what I'd call a useful proxy, albeit an understated one: per-share book value. Now, I should point out that book value is meaningless for most companies - it's like using a thermometer to measure wind speed. But at Berkshire, it's different. Our book value roughly tracks our business value, though it's important to understand that the gap between intrinsic value and book value grows in most years. Over time, this gap will likely become larger in absolute terms, but it tends to remain relatively steady as a percentage as both numbers grow. Think of it as two trains moving on parallel tracks - they're maintaining the same relative distance even as they both move forward."

What we've seen is that this crucial sector has essentially been in its own private depression, and I believe this is the main reason why employment recovery has lagged behind the improvement we've seen in virtually every other part of our economy. Now, while monetary and fiscal policies are important tools - think of them as medicine for an ailing economy - they can't create households or make excess housing units disappear. That's just not how it works. But here's the good news: demographics and our market system - which has served us remarkably well since 1776 - will eventually restore the needed balance. I expect this will happen sooner rather than later. When we get back to building one million or more residential units annually, which we will, you'll see something interesting happen. The pundits will be shocked at how quickly unemployment drops. It's like a coiled spring - once housing rebounds, the employment situation will improve faster than many expect. And this ties into something I've always believed: America's best days lie ahead. That's been true since 1776, and it remains true today."

The real question isn't about any single year though - it's about how we do over time. Let me give you some concrete evidence: we've looked at all 42 five-year periods since we took over Berkshire in 1965, and in every single one of those periods, our book value growth beat the S&P. Now, I should note that this streak might well break if the S&P puts together a strong five-year run, which could be happening as we speak. But that's okay - we're not trying to win every quarter or even every year. We're playing a longer game. The key is consistency over time, and our approach has proven itself through various market cycles. Think of it as a marathon, not a sprint.

Now, while Charlie and I certainly like to see gains in both areas, we're primarily focused on building operating earnings. Here's why: over time, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we're always on the lookout for large operations we can acquire that will give us an additional boost. Think about intrinsic value as being driven by these two engines - our investments and our operating businesses. While both matter, it's the operating earnings that really excite us because they represent the ongoing productive capacity of our businesses. These earnings tend to be more reliable and grow more consistently over time. The investment portfolio is important, but it's the operating businesses that really drive our long-term value creation. That's why when we look at potential acquisitions, we're thinking about how they can contribute to our operating earnings power over the long haul."

First, the company must have ample funds to handle all its operational and liquidity needs. We never want to compromise the business's core strength just to buy back stock. Second, and this is absolutely crucial, the stock must be selling at a material discount to the company's intrinsic business value, and we calculate that conservatively. You see, I've watched many companies violate this second principle over the years. Sometimes it's innocent - CEOs often have an eternal optimism about their stock's value. But other times, well, the motivations aren't so pure. Just having excess cash or wanting to offset stock issuances isn't enough justification. The fundamental rule here is simple: what's smart at one price becomes dumb at another. If you're paying above intrinsic value, you're actually hurting your continuing shareholders, and that's something we won't do at Berkshire."

We believe the long-term growth of Berkshire comes from two main channels: first, increasing the earnings of the businesses we already own, and second, acquiring new operations that can give us additional earnings power. Right now, we've got eight subsidiaries that would each make the Fortune 500 if they were standalone companies. That leaves us 492 more to go! And believe me, I'm actively looking. As for share repurchases, we take a very disciplined approach. Last September, we were willing to buy shares at up to 110% of book value, but we only managed to acquire $67 million worth before the price moved beyond our limit. This illustrates our philosophy perfectly - we'll repurchase shares when it makes sense, but we won't chase the price up just to deploy capital. The key is always to allocate capital intelligently, whether that's through acquisitions or share repurchases."

When we can buy our own stock at, say, 0.9x or 0.8x of what we know it's worth, it's like shooting fish in a barrel after all the water's been drained out. At Berkshire, we've set a clear limit of 110% of book value for repurchases because at that price or lower, we know we're increasing per-share intrinsic value for continuing shareholders. But let me be crystal clear about something - we're not in the business of supporting the stock price. We'll be aggressive buyers at our price limit or below if the opportunity presents itself, but our bids will disappear in particularly weak markets. And we maintain another important guardrail: we won't buy back shares if our cash holdings drop below $20 billion. That's non-negotiable. The whole approach is about being disciplined and rational - we like making money for continuing shareholders, but we'll only do it when the price is right."

On one hand, we have a clear obligation to continuing shareholders to increase their value, and buying our own stock below intrinsic value is about as sure a way as you'll find to do that. But we also feel a responsibility to those partners who are selling. Even though our buying might give them a slightly better price than they'd get without our bid, we still don't enjoy cashing them out at a discount to true value. That's why we believe strongly in transparency - we want exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of what they're selling. It's a balancing act, you see. We have to look after the interests of continuing shareholders by making smart capital allocation decisions, but we want to be fair to everyone involved. That's why we're so focused on the price/value relationship in our repurchase decisions - and by the way, Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan is another CEO who really understands this principle well. The key is to be disciplined about when and how we repurchase shares, always keeping in mind that our primary duty is to increase value for those who stay with us for the long term."

First, naturally, we want the company's earnings to increase at a good clip for a long time - that's just basic business sense. But secondly, and this surprises many people, we actually hope the stock underperforms in the market for an extended period. You see, when a company we own is repurchasing shares, a lower stock price lets them buy more shares with the same amount of money. That's why this notion of 'talking our book' - going around promoting stocks we own - would actually work against our interests, not help us as many commentators assume. Take IBM as an example. Under Gerstner and Palmisano, they demonstrated brilliant financial management, using debt wisely and aggressively repurchasing their stock. But I should note that at Berkshire itself, we approach repurchases with clear boundaries - we won't buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings drop below $20 billion, and we won't artificially support the stock price. Our unquestionable financial strength always takes precedence over everything else."

Financial strength that is unquestionable takes precedence over all else at Berkshire - that's a fundamental principle we won't bend on. Additionally, and this is something shareholders should clearly understand: we have no interest in artificially supporting our stock price. While we may make bids to repurchase shares, those bids will fade in particularly weak markets. We're not in the business of propping up our stock price - we'll only repurchase when it makes sense within our strict financial framework. This might be different from what you see at other companies, but at Berkshire, we believe in maintaining an fortress-like balance sheet above all else.

Here's the math: IBM plans to spend $50 billion on repurchases. If the stock averages $200, they can buy 250 million shares, reducing the total to 910 million shares outstanding. At that point, our ownership would increase to 7%. But if the stock averages $300, they'd only be able to buy 167 million shares, leaving 990 million shares outstanding, and our ownership would only rise to 6.5%. Now, let's say IBM earns $20 billion in that fifth year. Under the lower price scenario, our share of those earnings would be $100 million greater than under the higher price scenario. And down the road, our shares would be worth about $1.5 billion more than if the repurchases had happened at higher prices. So while it might seem counterintuitive, a lower stock price during heavy repurchase periods can significantly benefit long-term shareholders like us at Berkshire. It's all about the math of ownership percentages and future earnings."

They're planning to spend around $50 billion on further repurchases over the next five years. This kind of financial management isn't just good housekeeping - it has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders.

Let me use our IBM investment as an example. If IBM's stock price stays lower, and they're using the same dollar amount for repurchases, they'll be able to buy more shares. This means our ownership percentage increases more than it would at higher prices. In fact, if IBM were to earn $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be $100 million greater under the 'disappointing' scenario of a lower stock price than at the higher price. Later on, our shares could be worth $1.5 billion more than if the high-price repurchase scenario had occurred.

This fundamental shift in perspective has shaped how I view investments like our IBM position. While the ultimate success of such investments primarily depends on future earnings, I now understand that an important secondary factor is how many shares a company can purchase with its buyback programs. When prices are lower, those buybacks become more effective. Charlie and I realize we won't convince everyone to think this way - we've seen enough human behavior to know that's futile.

The real beauty of it comes when we can achieve an underwriting profit, which we've done for nine straight years with gains totaling $17 billion.

Now, we probably won't see much more growth in our float from current levels, mainly because we already have an outsized amount compared to our premium volume.

Think about it - everyone's fighting for profitable business, and that competition is so vigorous that it typically drives the entire property-casualty industry into significant underwriting losses. Let me give you a concrete example from the text - look at State Farm. They're the largest insurer in the country and a well-managed company, but even they've had underwriting losses in eight of the last eleven years. That really tells you something about how difficult this is. As I noted in the text, there are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is remarkably resourceful in creating new ones. That's why I'm particularly proud that we've managed to operate at an underwriting profit for nine consecutive years. While I believe we'll continue to underwrite profitably in most future years, I'm not naive enough to think we'll do it in all of them. This business is just too competitive for that kind of perfection."

Think about it this way - we have $70.6 billion of float that's treated in our accounting as if we have to pay it all back tomorrow, which isn't the reality at all. It's more like having someone deposit that enormous sum with us, pay us to hold it, and then let us invest it for our own benefit. The key here is that our float is both cost-free and long-enduring - it's a revolving fund, not a short-term loan. Now, we do carry $15.5 billion of goodwill on our books for our insurance operations, which represents what we paid for these float-generating capabilities. But Charlie and I firmly believe the true economic value of this insurance goodwill - what we'd actually pay to acquire float of similar quality - is far, far greater than what's shown on our books. This gap between the accounting treatment and economic reality of our float is a huge reason why we believe Berkshire's intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value. But let me be clear - this isn't something you'll find just anywhere in the insurance industry. We don't think there's much Berkshire-quality float out there in the insurance world."

That's just common sense. In our case at Berkshire, we're in a fortunate position. Our insurance operations generate what we call cost-free float, which is extraordinarily valuable. When we look at our $15.5 billion of insurance goodwill on the books, Charlie and I believe its true economic value - what we would actually pay to purchase float of similar quality today - is significantly higher than that historical carrying value. But here's what's crucial to understand - this isn't typical in the P/C insurance industry. We've built something special at Berkshire, and we don't see much float of similar quality elsewhere in the insurance world. The value comes from having both cost-free and long-enduring float, combined with excellent underwriting performance. That's what makes our insurance goodwill so valuable beyond its accounting cost."

But at Berkshire, we've built something different. We have what I call 'Berkshire-quality' float, which is quite rare in the insurance world. This is one of the main reasons why our intrinsic business value is substantially higher than what you see on our books. But - and this is important - we didn't achieve this by accident. We have some truly terrific managers running extraordinary insurance operations. They're disciplined, they're smart, and they understand risk. Take Ajit Jain, for instance. He runs our reinsurance group, our largest float generator, and he combines capacity, speed, decisiveness, and brains in a way that's unique in the insurance business.

Meanwhile, all other major insurers and reinsurers would be drowning in red ink, and some would actually face insolvency. That's not by chance. We've deliberately structured our operations to maintain this level of security. Our approach, particularly under Ajit Jain's leadership, is to take on risks that others can't or won't handle, but to do so with extraordinary discipline. We have the capital and the brains to handle these risks, but we're far more conservative than most large insurers in terms of how much exposure we'll accept relative to our resources.

Third, you must set a premium that will deliver a profit after covering both your expected loss costs and operating expenses. And fourth - this is where many stumble - you have to be willing to walk away if you can't get the right premium. Now, here's the interesting part: many insurers actually do fine with the first three disciplines. They can analyze risks, evaluate probabilities, and calculate necessary premiums. But when it comes to that fourth discipline - walking away from bad business - they fall flat on their faces. They get caught in this trap of thinking, 'Well, our competitors are writing this business, so we have to do it too.' I've seen this mentality destroy value in many businesses, but it's particularly dangerous in insurance. Remember, in insurance, saying 'no' is often more important than saying 'yes.'

That's exactly the kind of independent thinking - though hopefully with better judgment - that we need in insurance. When everyone else is writing policies just because 'the other guy is doing it,' that's precisely when you need to stand firm and trust your own analysis. At Berkshire, we've seen time and again that the crowd can be wrong, especially in insurance. Just look at General Re - under Tad's leadership, they've stuck to their principles, followed the insurance commandments, and turned what was once a headache into a treasure.

Now, some might question such massive spending, but here's the key: these investments make sense because they deliver value both to us and to society. If we weren't making these investments in rail, just think about how much worse our highway congestion would be. The same principle applies at MidAmerican, where we're constantly investing to meet our customers' future needs. Here's the beautiful part of the social compact in regulated businesses - when we operate efficiently and reliably, providing good service to our customers, we can earn fair returns on these investments.

Brad Kinstler, who became CEO in 2006, deserves credit for taking the company to new heights. The principle works because when you build a strong brand, you're not just selling commodities anymore - you're selling a promise, a reputation, an experience that customers value and will pay a premium for.

But here's what's interesting: by maintaining old-fashioned loan policies, particularly meaningful down payments and monthly payments that make sense relative to borrowers' regular income, Clayton kept losses at acceptable levels. This worked even when many borrowers had negative equity. The contrast with the broader housing market is striking. The U.S. went completely off the rails with its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies, and we're still paying a huge price for those mistakes. Clayton's success isn't about complex financial engineering - it's about common sense lending.

The government, lenders, borrowers, media, rating agencies - they all participated in this dance. What made it particularly dangerous was how homeowners started treating their houses like ATM machines. They felt wealthier on paper and rushed to 'monetize' these paper gains through refinancing. This created a massive consumption spree throughout the economy. Here's an interesting fact that often gets overlooked: Many people who lost their homes through foreclosure actually came out ahead financially because they had previously done cash-out refinancings for more than their original cost. In these cases, the homeowners actually won, and the lenders took the hit. But like all bubbles throughout history, this one had to burst. It's just the nature of bubbles - they always pop eventually."

Right now, we're seeing household formations consistently exceeding housing starts, which is exactly what needs to happen to work through the excess inventory. Think of it like a bathtub - we needed to stop pouring in more water (new housing starts) while the drain (household formations) keeps working to bring down the water level (excess inventory). This process takes time, but it's fundamentally sound. Looking at our Clayton business, for example, we expect their earnings to improve materially once this excess housing inventory is worked off. However, I should note that when I look at our three businesses in this sector today, I believe their intrinsic value is pretty much in line with their book value. We're seeing the healing process at work, but these things can't be rushed - they take time to play out naturally."

You see, the world can throw some nasty curveballs at you - maybe a worldwide financial panic or, heaven forbid, a massive terrorist attack. These black swan events can trigger sudden, huge collateral requirements. That's exactly the kind of surprise we don't want in our business. Now, we're not against all derivatives - we've done quite well with our insurance-like derivatives in high-yield bond indices. In fact, we collected $3.4 billion in premiums and paid out $2.6 billion in losses, giving us a nice underwriting profit. Plus, we averaged about $2 billion in float over five years. But here's the key - we only enter these contracts when the premium is commensurate with the risk. It's like our insurance business - we're happy to take risks, but only when we're properly compensated for them."

These positions are a good example - we've held $4.2 billion of float for more than fifteen years, plus we've already realized $222 million in profit from contracts we repurchased. Now, at year-end, our books showed a liability of $8.5 billion for the remaining contracts, but our actual payment would have been $6.2 billion if they had come due then. This demonstrates something crucial about our investment approach - we look for situations where we can get both the use of money (float in this case) and a good probability of profit. The key is to make sure you're getting properly compensated for the risk you're taking.

Think of it as delayed gratification - you're choosing not to consume today so you can consume more in the future. This isn't just semantic wordplay. When we evaluate investments at Berkshire, we're always thinking about whether we'll actually be able to buy more goods and services with our returns after accounting for taxes and inflation. That's what really matters to our shareholders. The dollar amounts alone can be deceptive if they don't translate into greater purchasing power. So while others might focus on nominal returns, we stay focused on what those returns actually mean in terms of future buying power."

The real risk of an investment is the probability - and I emphasize reasoned probability - that it will cause you to lose purchasing power over your holding period. Price fluctuations alone don't equal risk. An investment can bounce around quite a bit in price and still not be particularly risky if we're reasonably certain it will deliver increased purchasing power over time. And here's something that might surprise people - an asset with a very stable price can actually be loaded with risk if it's likely to erode your purchasing power. Think about a money market fund that barely moves in price but yields less than inflation - that's actually quite risky from our perspective because you're guaranteed to lose purchasing power over time. So when we evaluate risk at Berkshire, we're looking at the likelihood of permanent loss of purchasing power, not short-term price movements. That's why we spend our time analyzing the fundamental economics of businesses rather than their stock price volatility."

Over the past century, these instruments have repeatedly destroyed purchasing power, even while faithfully paying interest and principal. The fundamental problem is that governments control the ultimate value of money, and they often gravitate toward inflationary policies. Look at what's happened right here in the United States - since I took over Berkshire in 1965, the dollar has lost an astounding 86% of its value. Think about that - it now takes $7 to buy what $1 bought back then. So when a tax-free institution earns what looks like a decent interest rate on bonds, they're often just treading water or even losing ground in real terms. They need 4.3% just to maintain purchasing power. That's not investment income - that's just trying to stay even. And remember, this is in the U.S., where we have a relatively stable currency. In many other countries, the destruction of purchasing power has been far worse."

But here's the catch - if you're paying personal income taxes at an average rate of 25%, that 5.7% return essentially gives you nothing in terms of real income after accounting for inflation. You're running in place, or worse, moving backward. This is why I always emphasize understanding the difference between nominal returns and real, after-tax returns. The tax collector and inflation are like partners working against the individual investor in currency-denominated investments. You have to earn enough to overcome both inflation and taxes just to preserve your purchasing power. And that's not even talking about actually growing your wealth. This is why these supposedly 'safe' investments can be so dangerous for long-term investors - they create an illusion of safety while steadily eroding your real wealth."

But here's the real kicker - the invisible inflation tax can eat up the remaining 4.3 points. What's particularly interesting is that this implicit inflation 'tax' is actually more than triple the explicit income tax that most investors focus on. You see, while 'In God We Trust' may be on our currency, the printing press is operated by humans, and they've been quite active. Now, there were times, like in the early 1980s, when high interest rates did adequately compensate investors for inflation risk. But that's not the case today. That's why I believe bonds should come with a warning label under current conditions. The rates simply don't offset the purchasing-power risk that investors are taking on."

It's simple - they're the only investment that we can absolutely count on for liquidity under the most chaotic economic conditions. Beyond meeting our liquidity needs and regulatory requirements, we're very selective about currency-related securities. We'll only purchase them in two specific scenarios: either when we spot a mispriced credit opportunity, which can happen during periodic junk-bond debacles, or when interest rates rise to levels that create the potential for substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates eventually fall. But our primary holding remains Treasury bills, despite their low yields, because maintaining adequate liquidity is non-negotiable in our business model."

But here's the key point - we're currently 180 degrees removed from either of those situations. I particularly appreciate what Shelby Cullom Davis said about the current bond market: 'Bonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.' That really hits the nail on the head. We've made money on bonds in the past, and we might do so again, but only when the conditions are right. Right now, they're simply not."

In the 17th century, they became quite the sensation among these types of buyers. The whole system requires an expanding pool of buyers, who are drawn in by the belief that this pool will keep expanding. What's fascinating is that owners aren't inspired by what the asset itself can produce - because it won't produce anything - they're inspired by the belief that others will want it even more desperately in the future. Gold is the prime example of this today. It's hugely popular among investors who are fearful of almost all other assets, especially paper money. And while they're right to be fearful about paper money, that doesn't necessarily make gold the answer. Remember, it's just an asset that will remain lifeless forever, producing nothing."

If you own an ounce of gold today and hold it for a hundred years, you'll still just have that same ounce. It can't produce anything. What really drives gold's price isn't its inherent value - because it will remain lifeless forever - but rather the belief that somebody else will pay more for it in the future. The buyers are essentially betting that fear will increase and more people will want gold as a safe haven. Now, that belief has worked out over the past decade, I'll grant you that.

This is what I call the 'bandwagon' effect. These new investors see the rising prices as proof that it's a good investment, and they create their own truth - for a while. What's particularly interesting is how even skeptical investors eventually succumb to what they see as 'proof' from the market. The pool of buyers expands just enough to keep the bandwagon rolling for a time. But here's the key thing to remember - bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. There's an old proverb that I think captures this perfectly: 'What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.' When you see people buying something not for what it can produce but simply because they believe others will pay more later, that's a dangerous sign.

While they're still good businesses, they require substantial new capital investment during inflationary periods just to maintain earnings. But here's the key thing - even those businesses that need some reinvestment are still far superior to nonproductive or currency-based assets. Why? Because they're actually producing something people want and need.
