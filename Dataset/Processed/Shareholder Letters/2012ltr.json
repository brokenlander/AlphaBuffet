But that's exactly what it was when measured against our primary benchmark - the S&P 500. For the ninth time in 48 years, our percentage increase in book value fell short of the S&P's percentage gain, including dividends and price appreciation. What's interesting is that in eight of those nine underperforming years, the S&P had gained 15% or more. We actually tend to do better when the wind is in our face, so to speak. Now, we've managed to outperform the S&P over five-year stretches 43 times, which is our longer-term measuring stick. But with the S&P advancing for four straight years now, our streak of five-year wins might end if the market continues up in 2013. But here's what's absolutely crucial - Charlie and I won't change our yardsticks just because we're underperforming. We believe in measuring ourselves consistently, through good times and bad."

In 2012 specifically, we achieved a total gain of $24.1 billion for shareholders. After using $1.3 billion for stock repurchases, we had a net worth increase of $22.8 billion, translating to a 14.4% increase in per-share book value for both our Class A and Class B stock. What's particularly noteworthy about our performance is its consistency over long periods. We've never had a five-year period of underperformance versus the S&P 500 in our history, managing to surpass the index 43 times over such stretches. That's the kind of long-term performance metric that really matters to us at Berkshire. While we may have shorter periods where we lag behind, like we're seeing recently with the S&P's four-year winning streak, we maintain our focus on sustainable, long-term value creation."

Our job - and we're very focused on this - is to increase Berkshire's intrinsic business value at a faster rate than the S&P gains. We use book value as a proxy for this, though it's significantly understated. Now, if we can't beat the S&P over time, we're essentially not bringing any value to our shareholders. Think about it - any investor can buy a low-cost index fund and get S&P returns. That's why we won't change our measuring stick, even when it doesn't look favorable for us. We're actually likely to underperform in particularly strong market years, and that's okay. Where we tend to shine is when the market is down or flat. This comes from having outstanding businesses, terrific operating managers, and a shareholder-oriented culture. We believe we'll beat the S&P by a small margin over time, but we're not going to sugarcoat it when we fall short. That's just how we operate at Berkshire."

Heinz. This was particularly interesting because we partnered with Jorge Paulo Lemann and his group for the other 50%. This kind of deal shows how we're patient but ready to move when the right opportunity presents itself. You see, at Berkshire, we're always on the hunt for these elephant-sized acquisitions, but we won't force a deal just to make one. We wait for the right combination of business quality, price, and partnership. The Heinz deal exemplifies this - we found a great business and excellent partners to work with. This is how we approach these large acquisitions - we stay patient, keep our powder dry, and when the right elephant comes along, we're ready to act decisively."

These companies have marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. Our stakes in these companies keep increasing, both through direct purchases and through their share repurchases, which boost our ownership percentages. As Mae West wisely said, 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.' You see, our flexibility in capital allocation gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves only to acquisitions they can operate. Take our Big Four investments - while we only record the dividends we receive (about $1.1 billion), our portion of their total earnings was $3.9 billion. Those retained earnings, about $2.8 billion worth, are just as valuable to us as what we record. They're often used for repurchases - which enhance our share of future earnings - and for funding advantageous business opportunities. Over time, we expect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. That's why I'd much rather own a meaningful piece of a wonderful business than all of a mediocre one."

Now, some might look at that $2.8 billion difference and think we're missing out, but that's not the case at all. Those retained earnings are every bit as valuable to us as what we record. Here's why: when these companies retain earnings, they typically use them in two very beneficial ways. First, they fund share repurchases, which automatically increase our ownership percentage - just look at how Coca-Cola and American Express's repurchases helped raise our ownership from 8.8% to 8.9% and 13.0% to 13.7% respectively. Second, they invest in advantageous business opportunities that help grow the company. We've seen this work wonderfully with all four companies - they're marvelously run businesses with shareholder-oriented managers who make smart capital allocation decisions. That's why our ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Remember what Mae West said: 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.'

That's 19% more than our previous high in 2011. Charlie and I absolutely love putting large sums to work in worthwhile projects, regardless of what the pundits are saying. You know, I like that Gary Allan song that says 'Every Storm Runs Out of Rain' - that's our philosophy. The reality is, uncertainty has been a constant since 1776. Sometimes people obsess over the many uncertainties that always exist, and sometimes they ignore them completely. The key is to keep your foot on the gas when you see good opportunities.

First, they fund share repurchases, which increase our share of future earnings - that's simple arithmetic. Second, they fund business opportunities that usually work out well for us. We expect substantially greater earnings from these four companies over time. When we're right about this, two good things happen: our dividends increase, and even more importantly, our unrealized capital gains grow - which were already at $26.7 billion at yearend for these four investments.

Look at the 20th century - the Dow Jones went from 66 to 11,497, that's a 17,320% increase. And that's with four major wars, a Great Depression, and multiple recessions thrown in. Plus, investors got substantial dividends throughout that period. Now, some folks think they can outsmart the market by dancing in and out based on expert predictions or economic indicators. Charlie and I believe that's a terrible mistake. The risks of being out of the game are far greater than being in it. Let me give you a personal example. I made my first stock purchase in 1942, right when America was taking heavy losses in the Pacific war. Headlines were terrible every day. But every American believed we would prevail, and look what happened - GDP per capita more than quadrupled on an inflation-adjusted basis between 1941 and 2012. Yes, tomorrow is always uncertain, but America's destiny has consistently been one of ever-increasing abundance. That's why trying to time the market based on short-term worries or expert predictions is, in our view, a fool's errand."

Float is the money we hold between when premiums are paid to us and when we eventually pay claims. The beautiful thing about float is that we get to invest this money for Berkshire's benefit during that period. What's particularly wonderful is how stable and predictable our float has been - it grows right alongside our premium volume. Just look at the numbers: we went from $39 million in 1970 to over $73 billion in 2012. That's quite a growth story. Now, what makes float especially valuable is when we can generate an underwriting profit. In that case, we're essentially being paid to hold billions of dollars that we can invest. It's like taking out a loan and having the bank pay you interest - that's a pretty good deal if you can get it! However, I should note that achieving underwriting profits isn't easy. The intense competition in the insurance industry means many companies actually operate at an underwriting loss just to hold their float. That's effectively the price they pay for the privilege of holding and investing that money."

On the positive side, GEICO's float will almost certainly continue to grow. That's a bright spot. However, in our National Indemnity reinsurance division, we have several run-off contracts where the float naturally drifts lower over time. The important thing for shareholders to understand is that if we do see any decline in float in the future, it won't be dramatic. At the very worst, we're looking at no more than 2% decrease in any given year. It would be a very gradual process. This stability is one of the key strengths of our insurance operations - we don't see wild swings in our float levels relative to our premium volume."

Take State Farm, which is a well-managed company and the country's largest insurer. They had underwriting losses in eight out of eleven years through 2011. But at Berkshire, we've done something different. We've operated at an underwriting profit for ten consecutive years, with our pre-tax gain totaling $18.6 billion. This means our float is actually better than free money - we're getting paid to hold it. And here's what's really important: while accounting rules make us show float as a liability, as if we had to pay it all out tomorrow, that's not the right way to think about it. Our float is more like a revolving fund that's both costless and long-enduring. When you have float with those characteristics, its true value is dramatically less than what the accounting liability suggests. Looking ahead, I believe we'll continue to underwrite profitably in most years, which makes our float an incredibly valuable asset for Berkshire, even though it appears as a liability on our books."

This goodwill essentially represents what we paid for the float-generating capabilities of these operations. But here's the key thing to understand - the original cost of that goodwill has absolutely no bearing on its true value today. I'll give you a clear example: if an insurance business consistently runs large underwriting losses over a long period, any goodwill on the books should be considered worthless, regardless of what was paid for it initially. It's a partial offset to what I consider an overstated float liability in our accounting. You see, while we have to show our float as a full liability, as if we had to pay it all out immediately, that's not the economic reality of our business. The true value of an insurance operation's goodwill isn't about historical cost - it's about the current and future ability to generate profitable float.

Think about an insurance operation that's consistently losing money on its underwriting - in that case, the goodwill on its books becomes worthless, regardless of what someone paid for it originally. Now, at Berkshire, we're in a very different situation. Charlie and I have looked at this carefully, and we believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill is far higher than what our books show. If we were to go out today and try to buy insurance operations that generate the quality of float we have, we'd happily pay much more than our carrying value. This isn't just academic - it's one of the main reasons why we're confident Berkshire's intrinsic value is significantly above its book value.

The industry's return on tangible equity has consistently lagged behind the average American business, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. But there's another problem that makes the outlook even worse. Insurance companies are currently benefiting from what I call 'legacy' bond portfolios - these are older bonds that pay higher yields than what's available in today's market. These portfolios are essentially wasting assets. As these bonds mature, insurers will have to reinvest at much lower rates, and this could go on for many years. This isn't just a temporary challenge - it's going to significantly hurt insurers' earnings as they roll over their bonds. That's why we're so focused at Berkshire on maintaining what we call 'Berkshire-quality' float, which is quite rare in the insurance world.

Second, you need to conservatively evaluate both the likelihood of those exposures causing losses and what they might cost you. Third, you must set premiums that'll give you a profit after covering both your expected losses and operating expenses. But here's the kicker - the fourth one is where many insurers stumble: you've got to be willing to walk away if you can't get the right premium. You see, this is where discipline really matters. I've watched countless insurers master the first three points but then fall into the trap of following the herd. They hear 'The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,' and that's when trouble starts. In insurance, more than perhaps any other business, this mentality can be absolutely deadly to long-term profitability. Just look at General Re under Tad Montross - by following all four of these commandments religiously, they've maintained a float that's better than cost-free.

What's particularly impressive is that under Tony's leadership, GEICO's actual performance has been even better than what shows up in the GAAP numbers - like that $680 million underwriting profit we saw last year. You see, this kind of success doesn't happen by accident. It comes from having someone who truly understands the insurance business from the ground up, who's lived through multiple market cycles, and who's internalized those four key insurance disciplines I mentioned earlier. Tony's leadership at GEICO exemplifies what happens when you combine deep experience with disciplined underwriting principles. That's why GEICO has become such a powerhouse in our insurance operations."

It's like an old instinct that's hard to shake. The results of these bargain-hunting adventures have ranged from tolerable to terrible. But here's the important part: when I've strayed from Charlie's wisdom, it's usually been with smaller purchases, which limited the damage. Our large acquisitions, where we've focused on wonderful businesses even at higher prices, have generally worked out well, and in some cases, more than well. The businesses we own that enjoy terrific economics can earn anywhere from 25% after-tax to more than 100% on unleveraged net tangible assets. That's the power of wonderful businesses. Compare that to the fair businesses that might give you 12-20% returns. The mathematics of it is pretty simple - a wonderful business compounds your wealth at a much higher rate over time, even if you pay a fair price for it."

But here's how we think about it: In our business group, we employ $22.6 billion of net tangible assets and earn 16.3% after-tax on that base. That's a decent return on capital, even accounting for the premiums we've paid. The key is to look at the business as a single entity and evaluate its ability to generate returns on the total capital deployed. Some of our operations in this group have truly outstanding economics, earning 25% to over 100% on unleveraged net tangible assets. Others are good but not great, in the 12-20% range. And yes, I've made some capital allocation mistakes that resulted in very poor returns. But when you look at the overall picture, we're getting acceptable returns on our total capital, including the premiums we've paid.

And here's the really fascinating part about the business model - advertisers typically paid almost all of the cost, and readers essentially got a free ride on their coattails.

Because those advertisers - whether it was Sears, Safeway, or the local department store - needed what I call a 'megaphone' to reach the most people. They'd naturally go where the readers were. Then, because that paper had more ads - including those multi-page spreads from competing stores - it became more valuable to readers. After all, people wanted to know about job listings, apartment rentals, weekend specials at the supermarket, and which movies were playing. This created a self-reinforcing cycle - more ads drew more readers, and more readers drew more ads. I call this the 'survival of the fattest.' It was inevitable because most people only wanted to subscribe to one paper, and once one paper gained the upper hand in this cycle, it became virtually unstoppable. That's why almost every city eventually became a one-newspaper town, or you'd see two papers merge into a single economic unit."

The advertisers needed us more than we needed any single advertiser. And here's what made it even better - these ads weren't just ads to the readers. They were actually vital information that people desperately wanted. Readers needed to know about job openings, apartment listings, grocery specials, and entertainment options. So you had this beautiful situation where the product was indispensable to both advertisers and readers. That's why I always say that even poor management couldn't ruin these monopoly papers. As that Southern publisher so candidly put it - and I love this quote - 'I owe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions - nepotism and monopoly.' He was absolutely right.

When you give something away for free in one place and charge for it in another, you shouldn't be surprised when your paid circulation drops sharply. This creates what I call a reverse virtuous circle - falling circulation makes the paper less valuable to advertisers, which leads to reduced ad revenue, which then puts more pressure on the subscription model. The Wall Street Journal and the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, under Walter Hussman Jr.'s leadership, figured this out early. They implemented pay models and have done much better at maintaining their circulation. It's taken most other papers, including ours, quite a while to catch up to this thinking.

At Berkshire, I specifically ask our subsidiary managers to focus unendingly on finding these moat-widening opportunities. Now, this doesn't always work out perfectly - sometimes our managers, like all humans, start with the answer they want and work backwards to justify it. I've been guilty of this myself. Just look at our original textile business where we spent twenty years of management effort and capital improvements that turned out to be completely futile. That's why it's crucial to be objective when evaluating reinvestment opportunities. While we love receiving dividends from companies we own, the decision to pay them should only come after carefully evaluating all potential internal investment opportunities.

I'll give you a personal example of this. In our original textile business, we spent twenty years of management effort and capital improvements trying to make it work. Looking back, as I admitted in our 1986 annual report, it was an exercise in futility. We were probably guilty of starting with the desired answer - that we could turn the textile business around - and then trying to justify continued investment.

At Berkshire, we've been very specific about our criteria. We initially said we wouldn't pay more than 110% of book value, but I'll admit that proved unrealistic in practice. We had to adjust our thinking, and in December we increased that limit to 120% when we saw a large block available at about 116% of book value. That's the kind of flexibility you need while maintaining discipline. If the opportunity presents itself - meaning if our stock trades at these levels - we're prepared to buy large quantities of our stock. But the key word here is 'disciplined.'

Our board and I carefully considered this and concluded that continuing shareholders benefit meaningfully from purchases up to our 120% limit.

Now, we can reasonably expect to keep earning that same 12% on reinvested earnings. Here's where it gets interesting - we know there are always outsiders willing to buy into our business at 125% of net worth, which means each of our stakes is worth $1.25 million. Now, let's say you propose that we pay out one-third of our earnings as dividends and reinvest two-thirds. Your thinking is that this balances current income needs with growth. Under this scenario, we'd pay out $80,000 in dividends ($40,000 to each of us) and reinvest $160,000. The math shows us that with this approach, both dividends and stock value would increase by 8% annually - that's our 12% earned on net worth minus the 4% we're paying out.

Not only that, but their annual cash receipts from selling shares would be running 4% higher than what they'd receive from dividends. Now, this assumes we can earn about 12% annually on net worth and that shareholders can sell at 125% of book value. These aren't pie-in-the-sky numbers - look at the S&P 500, which actually earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at an even higher premium to book value. At Berkshire, while we can't guarantee these results, they're reasonable assumptions based on our track record. In fact, over our history - though I should note that's a performance we won't come close to repeating - the sell-off policy has produced dramatically superior results compared to what a dividend policy would have delivered.

Let me explain: When you establish a dividend policy - let's say paying out 40% of earnings - you're essentially imposing that specific cash-out policy on every single shareholder. But here's the reality: we have about 600,000 shareholders, and they all have different needs and preferences. Some might want 30% in cash, others might want 50%, and many might not want any cash at all right now. In fact, a great many of our shareholders - possibly even most of them - are in what I call a net-savings mode, meaning they're building wealth rather than seeking regular income. For these investors, it's actually logical to prefer no payment at all. Why force cash onto shareholders who would rather keep their money compounding within the business? The beauty of the sell-off approach is that it lets each shareholder tailor their own cash flow by deciding individually when and how much to sell. It's simply more flexible and respects the diverse needs of our investor base."

        "value": "Well, it really comes down to giving our shareholders more flexibility and better tax efficiency. You see, when we let shareholders sell shares instead of paying dividends, each person can decide exactly how much cash they want to take out. Some might want to sell 60% of their annual earnings equivalent, others 20%, and many - particularly those in savings mode - might prefer to sell nothing at all. With dividends, we'd be forcing the same payout on everyone, whether they want it or not. And here's the real kicker on taxes: with dividends, shareholders get taxed on every dollar they receive. But with our sell-off approach, they're only taxed on the gain portion of their sales. Plus, if someone wanted to reinvest dividends, they'd take a double hit - paying taxes first, and then paying a 25% premium above book value to buy back in through the open market. That's like paying a dollar to get back 75 cents. I've always believed in being rational about money, and forcing shareholders to take dividends when many would prefer to keep building capital just doesn't make sense to me."

Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares has decreased to 528,525,623 shares. Now, you might think this means I'm reducing my investment in the business - but that's not necessarily the case at all. You see, what matters isn't just the number of shares you own, but the underlying value of each share. When a company retains earnings and reinvests them effectively, the intrinsic value per share grows over time. So even with fewer shares, your total investment can actually increase if the per-share value grows more than enough to offset the reduction in share count. It's like having a smaller slice of a much bigger pie - you can end up with more pie even though your slice looks smaller. This is particularly relevant for our shareholders who are in a net-savings mode and prefer to see their capital compound within the business rather than being paid out as dividends."

Over the past seven years, I've been giving away about 4.25% of my Berkshire shares annually. My position has dropped from about 712 million B-equivalent shares to around 528 million shares - that's a significant decrease in ownership percentage, no question about it. But here's the interesting part: my investment value has actually grown substantially. The book value of my holdings increased from $28.2 billion in 2005 to $40.2 billion in 2012. So even though I own a smaller piece of the pie, it's a much bigger pie overall. This is why we focus on growing intrinsic business value at Berkshire. When you own part of a business that's consistently growing in value, you can actually end up with more wealth even while giving away shares. It's like having a goose that lays increasingly larger golden eggs - you can give away some of your ownership in the goose while still ending up with more gold overall."

Let me share what Phil Fisher - one of the greatest investment minds - said about this. He used a wonderful restaurant analogy that I think perfectly captures this concept. You can run a successful restaurant serving hamburgers or one serving Chinese food - but you need to pick your approach and stick with it. The same goes for dividend policy. When a company's dividend policy is erratic or unclear, it creates confusion among existing shareholders and drives away potential investors. Nobody wants to eat at a restaurant where you don't know what kind of food you'll get from one day to the next. Similarly, investors need to understand and be able to rely on a company's approach to dividends. That's why at Berkshire, we've always been very clear about our dividend philosophy. Consistency in dividend policy helps investors make informed decisions and properly value the company."

He used this wonderfully simple restaurant analogy: you can run a successful hamburger joint or a Chinese restaurant, but you can't switch back and forth between the two and expect to keep your customers happy. At Berkshire, we've taken this lesson to heart. We've consistently followed our own approach that's different from most companies, particularly regarding dividends and capital allocation. We stick to what works and what we understand. Just like that restaurant owner needs to pick a cuisine and master it, we've chosen our path and stayed with it. Now, that doesn't mean we're stubborn about it - we'll reexamine our approach if our assumptions about book-value buildup or market-price premium change materially. But the key is consistency and staying within your circle of competence. That's what builds trust with your shareholders, just like a restaurant builds trust with its regular customers."

For our 'Big Four' portfolio companies, we actually applaud their consistent dividend policies. Most of these companies try to increase their dividends annually and are very reluctant to cut them. Some of them also repurchase shares quite aggressively, which we love when done at appropriate prices. That's a sensible and understandable approach for them. But at Berkshire, we've consistently followed a different path. We believe our approach has been sensible for our specific situation, and we've tried to make it understandable to our shareholders through our communications. It's not that one approach is universally better than the other - it's about what makes sense given each company's circumstances and opportunities. We like increased dividends when our portfolio companies pay them, and we're particularly fond of repurchases when they're done at the right prices. But for Berkshire itself, we'll stick with our current policy as long as our fundamental assumptions remain valid."

They manage everything from our 21,500-page Federal tax return to coordinating with 48 universities for student Q&A sessions. They make my life extraordinarily easy and pleasant. You see, in the corporate world, you often see bloated headquarters with layers of bureaucracy. But our team proves you don't need that. They handle SEC requirements, shareholder inquiries, our annual report, and organize what's become the country's largest annual meeting - all with unbelievable efficiency. And they do it while keeping things personal - they even get me my hamburgers for lunch! This lean, efficient approach is part of our DNA at Berkshire.

That's incredibly important because it aligns perfectly with our shareholder-oriented philosophy. Let me tell you what makes this particularly special: most of these managers have no financial need to work. They're not doing it for the paycheck. They're doing it because they love hitting business 'home runs.' You can't put a price tag on that kind of motivation. I believe their shareholder orientation is unmatched among large publicly-owned companies. When you have managers who think like owners and are driven by the pure joy of business success rather than just monetary rewards, you've got something really special. It's like having star athletes who play for the love of the game, not just the contract. This mindset has been a crucial element in Berkshire's success over the years, and it's why I regularly extol their accomplishments. They deserve every bit of praise they get."
