These are excellent businesses run by talented, shareholder-oriented managers. I've always said it's better to have a partial interest in the Hope diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. Let me give you some numbers to show why this works so well for us. In 2013, our portion of just these four companies' earnings amounted to $4.4 billion. Now, we only report the dividends we receive in our earnings - about $1.4 billion that year. But that additional $3 billion they retain is just as valuable to us. Why? Because these companies often use retained earnings for stock repurchases, which increases our ownership percentage, or they fund advantageous business opportunities. In fact, just a one-tenth of a percent increase in our ownership of these companies collectively adds $50 million to Berkshire's share of their annual earnings. That's the power of owning pieces of truly wonderful businesses."

        "value": "Let me explain this through what's actually happening with our 'Big Four' investments. When companies like Coca-Cola and American Express repurchase their shares, our ownership percentage automatically increases without us spending a dime. For example, our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.9% to 9.1%, and our interest in American Express rose from 13.7% to 14.2% through their repurchase programs. Now, these might seem like small changes, but here's the important math: every tenth of a percent increase in our ownership of these four companies collectively adds $50 million to our share of their annual earnings. The earnings these companies retain instead of paying out as dividends - about $3 billion in 2013 - are often used for these repurchases or for funding business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. So while we might only report $1.4 billion in dividends, that $3 billion of retained earnings is every bit as valuable to us. It's working for us inside these wonderful businesses, compound our ownership and value over time."

You see, when companies like Apple or Coca-Cola keep their earnings and don't pay them out as dividends, they typically do two very important things with that money. First, they often buy back their own stock, which increases our ownership percentage without us spending a dime. That's like getting a bigger slice of the pie without ordering another pie. Second, they reinvest in their businesses, which usually turns out quite well for us as long-term owners. It's really quite simple - as these companies grow their per-share earnings over time, two good things happen for Berkshire: we get bigger dividend checks, and our unrealized capital gains grow substantially. Just look at the numbers - we already had $39 billion in unrealized gains from just four companies at yearend. So don't get too focused on what shows up in our reported earnings. The real value creation often happens quietly in those retained earnings."

I like to reference that Woody Allen quote about being bi-sexual doubling your chances for a Saturday night date - it's the same principle with our investment approach. By being open to both operating businesses and passive investments, we've essentially doubled our opportunities to find smart ways to deploy our cash. This flexibility has been fundamental to our approach since we took control of Berkshire in 1965. Take our BNSF purchase in 2009, for instance. During the Great Recession, we were able to make that massive investment - the largest in Berkshire's history - because we weren't constrained by having to operate everything we buy. It was an all-in wager on America's economic future, and we could make it because we're willing to look at any sensible opportunity, whether it's buying an entire business or taking a passive stake. Companies that limit themselves to only acquisitions they can operate are playing with one hand tied behind their back. With our endless gusher of cash, we need maximum flexibility to put it to work intelligently."

This fundamental belief in America's future shapes everything we do at Berkshire. We're not just making short-term plays; we're building businesses that will be essential parts of the American economy for generations to come. Look at BNSF and MidAmerican Energy - a century from now, they'll still be playing major roles in our economy. The same goes for our insurance operations. We're positioning Berkshire to capture this long-term growth through multiple avenues: improving our subsidiaries' earning power, making bolt-on acquisitions, benefiting from our investees' growth, and occasionally making large acquisitions. But we do this while maintaining supreme financial strength - always keeping at least $20 billion in cash equivalents and avoiding short-term obligations.

Second, we grow through bolt-on acquisitions that enhance these existing businesses. Third, we benefit from the organic growth of companies we've invested in. Fourth, we repurchase Berkshire shares when they're available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value. And fifth, we occasionally make large acquisitions when the right opportunity comes along. But here's what's crucial - we rarely, if ever, issue Berkshire shares. This disciplined approach is supported by our commitment to maintaining supreme financial strength. We always keep at least $20 billion in cash equivalents and avoid material amounts of short-term obligations. Look at our core businesses - take BNSF, MidAmerican Energy, and our insurance operations. These aren't trendy startups; they're essential businesses that will be just as important to the economy a century from now as they are today. That's what I mean by a rock-solid foundation. We're not building for the next quarter or even the next year; we're building for the next century. And when you combine these building blocks with America's inherent dynamism and growth, you've got a formula for creating lasting value."

That's just a fact of economic life. And when you're in the insurance business, you need to be there when people need you most. No company brings greater human and financial resources to that business than Berkshire. We've structured things this way very deliberately because we never want to be in a position where we can't meet our obligations or have to pass up an opportunity because we're short on cash. Charlie and I believe this conservative financial position is one of our greatest strengths. It's not exciting, but it's essential to our long-term success and the trust our insurance customers place in us."

But we do focus on two key quantitative factors that help us track our progress. First, we look at our per-share investments, which increased 13.6% to $129,253 in 2013. Second, we monitor our pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments, which grew 12.8% to $9,116 per share. Since 1970, these metrics have grown at compound annual rates of 19.3% and 20.6% respectively. It's not a coincidence that Berkshire's stock price over those 43 years has increased at a rate very similar to these two measures of value. While we like to see gains in both areas, Charlie and I most strongly focus on building operating earnings. That's where we believe the real long-term value creation happens. These aren't perfect measures, but they give us and our shareholders a reasonable framework for thinking about value creation at Berkshire."

Think of it as money that will eventually belong to others, but we get to invest and use for our benefit in the meantime. What makes this so powerful is that as our insurance business grows, our float tends to grow with it. Just look at our numbers - we went from $39 million in float in 1970 to over $77 billion by 2013. That's not a typo, billion with a B. This collect-now, pay-later model has been the engine that's consistently propelled Berkshire's expansion since 1967. It's worth noting though, as I mentioned in the report, that further gains in float will be tough to achieve at this point.

That's why we break it down this way. But here's what's interesting - while we view and present them separately, there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof. Take our insurance operation, for instance. It's been our core business and has consistently driven our expansion since 1967, helping us build that diversified base of earning power we've always sought. The key is understanding each business on its own terms while recognizing the synergies that come from having them all together in the Berkshire family."

As you can see from our numbers, we've grown it from just $39 million in 1970 to over $77 billion by 2013. Here's the beautiful part - if our premiums exceed our total expenses and eventual losses, we get an underwriting profit on top of the investment income from that float. In that scenario, we're essentially getting paid to hold other people's money. But here's the catch - and it's an important one - every insurer wants this, which creates intense competition. This competition is so vigorous that the property-casualty industry typically operates at an underwriting loss. Take State Farm, for example - they're the country's largest insurer and well-managed, but they had underwriting losses in nine out of twelve years through 2012. Think of the underwriting loss as the price the industry pays to hold its float. The competitive dynamics pretty much guarantee that the insurance industry will keep earning below-normal returns compared to other businesses, even with the float income. But what makes our situation unique is that we can never be subject to immediate demands for large sums compared to our cash resources, which gives us a significant advantage in how we can invest and manage that float."

Now, we do have some positives - GEICO's float will almost certainly grow, and that's something we're confident about. But if you look at our National Indemnity reinsurance division, we have several run-off contracts where the float is gradually declining. Here's the important thing to understand about our position though: if we do see a decline in float - and I emphasize if - it would be very gradual. We're looking at a maximum decline of no more than 3% in any year. This is because of how we've structured our insurance contracts. Unlike certain forms of life insurance, our property-casualty insurance contracts can never subject us to immediate demands for large sums compared to our cash resources. This gives us tremendous stability and predictability in our float position. Looking at our historical numbers, you can see how we've grown from just $39 million in 1970 to $77,240 million by 2013. While we may not see that kind of growth going forward, we've built our insurance operation to be incredibly stable and resilient."

While it shows up as a liability on our books - as if we'd have to pay it all out tomorrow - that's not the right way to think about it. Float is really more like a revolving fund. Look at how it works in practice: every day we're paying out claims - about $17 billion to more than five million claimants in 2013 - and that reduces our float. But simultaneously, we're writing new business that generates new claims, which adds to our float. It's a continuous cycle. Now, if that float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe ours will be, then the true value of this liability is actually far less than what the accounting statements show. Think of it this way - we have this $15.5 billion of 'goodwill' on our books from our insurance operations. That's counted as an asset. But I'd argue that our float, when properly valued as a revolving fund rather than a straight liability, is actually worth far more than the accounting numbers suggest. The key is having float that's both cost-free and persistent - that's what we've achieved at Berkshire through our focus on disciplined underwriting."

They had underwriting losses in nine out of twelve years through 2012. That's actually pretty typical in our industry - the competitive dynamics almost guarantee that most insurance companies will earn subnormal returns compared to other businesses. But at Berkshire, we've done something quite different. We've generated underwriting profits for eleven consecutive years straight, with our pre-tax gains totaling $22 billion over that period. This didn't happen by accident. Our insurance managers understand that while float is valuable, it can be completely undermined by poor underwriting results. They focus on this every single day. Looking ahead, I believe we'll continue to underwrite profitably in most years. This is crucial because profitable underwriting means our float costs us nothing - in fact, we get paid to hold it. That's fundamentally different from most insurance operations that pay to maintain their float through underwriting losses. When you combine cost-free float with disciplined underwriting, you create something truly valuable. That's what sets Berkshire's insurance operations apart."

Let me connect this to our goodwill numbers. We're carrying about $15.5 billion of goodwill attributable to our insurance companies. That goodwill largely represents what we paid for these float-generating capabilities. But - and this is important - the original cost of that goodwill doesn't determine its true value. Charlie and I firmly believe that the true economic value of our insurance goodwill - what we'd happily pay today for insurance operations with float of similar quality - far exceeds its historic carrying value on our books. This disconnect between accounting values and economic reality is one of the main reasons why we believe Berkshire's intrinsic business value is substantially higher than its book value."

If the insurance industry were hit with a mega-catastrophe causing a $250 billion loss - and that's about triple anything the industry has ever seen - Berkshire would likely still record a significant profit for the year. Why? Because we have many streams of earnings, not just insurance. Not only would we remain profitable, but we'd still be sitting there with plenty of cash, actually looking for opportunities that might arise if markets went into shock. Now, contrast that with other major insurers and reinsurers - they'd be deep in the red, with some possibly facing insolvency. That's the difference in our approach.

He's created an insurance business with $37 billion in float and a large cumulative underwriting profit, which is a feat no other insurance CEO has come close to matching. What's particularly impressive is how he's continued to expand the operation. Just look at what happened last June when he formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance. This moved us into commercial insurance, and we were immediately accepted by major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers across America. Why? Because these professionals understand that no other insurer can match Berkshire's financial strength, which means when claims come due - even years in the future - they'll be paid promptly and fully.

Third, you've got to set premiums that will deliver profits after covering both your expected losses and operating expenses. But here's the kicker - that fourth discipline is where many insurers stumble: you must be willing to walk away if you can't get the right premium. You see, many insurance operators can handle the first three just fine, but they get weak-kneed on number four. They see their competitors writing business and feel they have to jump in too. I've always said that following the 'other guy is doing it' mentality is dangerous in any business, but it's absolutely poisonous in insurance.

And that same operational efficiency is still their key asset today. You see, auto insurance is something nobody really wants to buy, but everyone who drives needs it. It's a major expense for most families. So when you can offer significant savings to customers - which only a low-cost operation can do - you've got a real competitive advantage. That's why GEICO has been able to consistently grow its market share year after year. Under Tony Nicely's leadership since 1993, this focus on cost efficiency has become even sharper. Tony started at GEICO when he was just 18 years old, and in his 52 years there, he's never lost sight of this fundamental principle.

Looking at General Re specifically, it's become a real gem in our portfolio, though I'll admit we had some rough patches initially. After we acquired it in 1998, there were some problems that had many people - including myself briefly - thinking I'd made a huge mistake.

You see, in the insurance business, customers care deeply about savings - that's just human nature. By operating at lower costs than our competitors, GEICO can offer better prices while maintaining healthy profits. This creates what I call a moat - an enduring competitive advantage that competitors simply can't cross. It's not a temporary advantage either. The beautiful thing about our cost structure is that it's self-reinforcing. As we grow and gain market share year after year, our cost advantages often become even more pronounced. That's why I believe GEICO's economic goodwill has grown tremendously - approaching $20 billion by our estimates, far above the goodwill we recorded when we bought the remaining half of GEICO in 1995 for $1.4 billion above its tangible assets. Our little gecko keeps telling Americans about these savings, and with our continued focus on reducing operating costs, that message becomes more compelling every year."

Within Berkshire, we've built a diverse insurance operation that includes three major units plus several smaller companies operating in specialized niches. What makes these operations particularly valuable to us is their ability to generate both underwriting profits and float. Look at our 2013 numbers - we had an underwriting profit of $3,089 million and float of $77,240 million. That's significant. Our smaller insurance companies, while not as well-known as GEICO or General Re, are particularly special to Charlie and me. They consistently deliver underwriting profits while operating in what I'd call odd corners of the insurance world. They provide us with substantial float and are steadily growing. The combination of disciplined underwriting and careful management of float has made our insurance operations incredibly valuable. Each unit, whether it's BH Reinsurance, General Re, GEICO, or our other primary insurers, contributes to this success in its own way. We treasure these operations and the managers who run them because they understand that in the promise-selling business, delivering on those promises while maintaining profitability is what creates lasting value."

Sometimes that promise won't be tested for decades, like when a 25-year-old buys life insurance. That time gap is what makes the strength and reliability of the insurer absolutely critical. The customer needs to know that when the time comes - maybe 30, 40, or 50 years down the road - the insurer will both be able and willing to pay, even if the economy is in complete chaos. That's why we've worked so hard at Berkshire to build unmatched financial strength. Our promises have no equal, and that's not just my opinion - it's demonstrated by the fact that the world's largest and most sophisticated insurers come to us when they want to shed their biggest, longest-term liabilities.

Think about that - we're going to be receiving claims decades from now for events that happened before 1993. Now, why would Lloyd's choose us for such a massive, long-term commitment? The answer lies in trust and financial strength. You see, when big insurers want to 'cede' their liabilities to a reinsurer, they have to be absolutely certain about their choice. Pick the wrong reinsurer - one that might become financially stressed or act badly - and those liabilities could bounce right back to them. That's why almost without exception, the largest insurers seeking this kind of help came to Berkshire. They know our promises are rock-solid, even though the ultimate payments, like in the Lloyd's case, are unknowable today."

I've never been a fan of EBITDA as a measure - it's seriously flawed in my view. For utilities like MidAmerican, we look at two critical factors. First, these businesses have recession-resistant earnings because they provide essential services that people need in good times and bad. You can't just stop using electricity because the economy is down. Second, and this is particularly important for MidAmerican, they have great diversity in their earnings streams. This protects us from being overly exposed to any single regulatory body. We've even strengthened this position with the NV Energy acquisition. This combination of stable earnings and regulatory diversification, plus Berkshire's ownership, allows these companies to borrow at very attractive rates.

These operations have such strong earning power that they can handle their debt obligations even in severe economic downturns.

These companies literally power the American economy every day. And while they use significant debt, it's important to understand that this debt is supported by extremely stable, essential-service businesses.

When we acquired these utilities, they had much lower satisfaction scores. But we understand that it's in our self-interest to operate in a way that earns approval from regulators and the people they represent. And here's the key thing - this reputation for responsible operation makes regulators in new states actually glad to see us coming. They know we'll be good stewards.

But then you have other intangibles, like customer relationships, where the amortization charges come purely from purchase-accounting rules. These charges aren't real economic costs at all. The problem is, GAAP accounting treats these two very different situations exactly the same way - both get recorded as expenses when calculating earnings. From an investor's viewpoint, these two types of charges couldn't be more different. One represents a real cost of doing business, while the other is essentially an accounting fiction.

But with amortization, I'd estimate only about 20% of those charges represent real economic costs. The rest is really just accounting fiction. In our own operations, we had $648 million in amortization charges, but only about one-fifth of that represents actual economic reality. This has become increasingly important as we've made more acquisitions, and it'll become even more significant as we buy more companies. Now, these non-real charges do eventually disappear after about 15 years when the assets are fully amortized - though I joke that it'll be my successor who gets to report those better-looking earnings. The key point for investors is this: when you're analyzing a business, you need to add back most of those amortization charges to get a true picture of economic reality.

This shows up in our goodwill figures, which are quite large. But here's the key point: despite these premiums, we're still getting a decent return on our deployed capital.

I didn't need to be an agricultural expert - in fact, I knew nothing about operating a farm. What I did was focus on the fundamentals: I learned from my son about the expected corn and soybean production and the operating costs. From those basic numbers, I could calculate a normalized return of about 10%. The price I paid was significantly below what the failed bank had lent against it earlier, so I was buying at a discount to its recent valuation. This is exactly what Graham taught - focus on the numbers, understand the basic economics, and ensure you have a margin of safety. I also saw that there was virtually no downside risk at that price, but there was substantial upside potential through improved productivity and higher crop prices - both of which did materialize.

What we saw was a classic bubble pattern: prices exploded upward based on a widespread belief in runaway inflation, and this was amplified by the lending policies of small rural banks. When the bubble burst, we saw price declines of 50% or more. The aftermath was actually more severe in some ways than what we saw in the recent Great Recession - five times as many Iowa and Nebraska banks failed following the farm bubble than failed during the Great Recession. The key lesson here is that leverage can be deadly when asset prices collapse. Those leveraged farmers who borrowed heavily during the boom years were devastated when prices fell, and they took their lenders down with them. But this also created opportunity for patient, rational investors - that's exactly how I was able to buy that farm from the FDIC in 1986 for far less than what the failed bank had lent against it. The pattern is remarkably consistent across different types of assets and different eras: excessive optimism combined with easy credit creates bubbles, the bubbles eventually burst, and then rational investors can find real value in the aftermath. The key is to be greedy when others are fearful, but only when you can identify solid underlying value."

That's proved out over time with tripled earnings and distributions now exceeding 35% of our original investment. The future productivity was predictable, even if I never set foot on the property.

I've always been direct about this: I can't speculate successfully, and I'm quite skeptical of anyone who claims they can do it consistently. Think about coin flippers - sure, half will win their first toss, but that doesn't mean they have any real edge going forward. You know, I'm often reminded of this when I hear TV commentators confidently predicting market movements. It brings to mind Mickey Mantle's observation about baseball broadcasters - 'You don't know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.' The same applies to market predictions. I've found that forming macro opinions or listening to market predictions is not just a waste of time - it's actually dangerous because it can distract you from the facts that really matter. When I made my investments in 1986 and 1993, I didn't care about what the economy or market might do the next year. I focused entirely on what those properties would produce."

You see, this isn't just philosophy - it's practical advice. If you find yourself constantly checking stock prices, try this: if you can enjoy weekends without looking at stock prices, give it a try on weekdays too. The daily ups and downs really shouldn't matter if you're investing properly. Remember, the fact that an asset has gone up in price recently is never, by itself, a reason to buy it. What matters is what that asset will produce going forward. Just like I knew that regardless of the headlines or market chatter, corn would keep growing in Nebraska and students would keep going to NYU.

I like to use my farm analogy here: Imagine if I had a neighbor who showed up every day, shouting different prices at which he'd buy my farm or sell me his. If his price was ridiculously low and I had cash, I'd buy his farm. If it was absurdly high, I could sell or just keep farming. That would be an advantage to me. But here's where many stock investors go wrong - they let these constant quotations and the often irrational behavior of other investors influence their own behavior. Instead of seeing these price swings as opportunities like my hypothetical farmer neighbor, they get caught up in the moment. They listen to all the chatter about markets, the economy, and price movements, thinking they need to act on every piece of commentary.

The market creates this environment where there's so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, and price behavior that investors feel compelled to listen to pundits and, even worse, act on their comments. The key lesson here is that the underlying principle of investment doesn't change whether you're owning stocks or real estate - it's the investor's behavior that changes. The real estate investor's natural behavior is actually the more rational one.

Think about it this way: if you owned a farm, would you seriously consider selling it because some neighbor was running around making wild predictions about crop prices? Of course not. The same principle applies to stocks. When you own shares of wonderful businesses, all that daily market commentary is just like an erratic and mouthy neighbor - it might be noisy, but it doesn't change the fundamental value of your investment.

The same logic applied to my stock holdings. Why would I sell small participations in wonderful businesses when I wouldn't have sold 100% ownership of a solid business with good long-term prospects? That would have been foolish. Sure, any individual investment might disappoint, but as a group, quality businesses were certain to do well over time. The key insight here is that market panics can actually be helpful to the true investor if they have cash available when prices get far out of line with values. Think about the fundamental question - could anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America? The answer was obviously no. That's why maintaining your positions - or better yet, adding to them - during times of panic is often the wisest course of action."

If we can answer yes to that question, and if the stock is selling at a price that makes sense relative to the lower end of our earnings estimate, we'll buy it. But here's the important part - if we can't make a sensible estimate of future earnings, we just move on to the next opportunity.

Most investors haven't made studying businesses their life's work, and that's perfectly fine. If they're wise, they'll recognize this limitation and conclude that they don't know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power. There's no shame in that - in fact, it's a valuable self-awareness that can prevent serious investment mistakes.

So rather than trying to pick individual winners, which neither you nor your 'helpers' can reliably do, the sensible approach is to own a piece of all of America's businesses. The simplest and most cost-effective way to do this is through a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. You're essentially betting on American business as a whole, and that's a bet that's worked wonderfully over time. Remember, you don't need to find the next Amazon or Apple. You just need to participate in the aggregate success of American business, and an index fund lets you do exactly that while keeping costs minimal."

The solution I recommend is straightforward: accumulate shares over a long period of time. Don't try to time the market. And here's the key part - never sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. That's usually precisely the wrong time to sell. If you follow these basic rules - gradually buying over time, staying diversified through something like an index fund, keeping costs low, and not selling during downturns - you're virtually certain to get satisfactory results.

It's exactly the same with stocks. The antidote to all this mistiming and trading is really quite simple: accumulate shares over a long period and never sell when the news is bad and stocks are well off their highs. You see, Wall Street makes its money by encouraging activity - there will always be someone trying to convince you to trade more because they profit from giving advice or making transactions happen. But these costs can be enormous and, for investors as a whole, provide absolutely no benefit. That's why I say ignore all the chatter and treat your stock investments like you would a farm.

This teaches us something vital about value investing: the ability to spot exceptional businesses early, when they're still small and misunderstood by the market, can lead to extraordinary long-term results. Ben demonstrated this by actually making the investment while writing about investment principles, not just talking about them in theory.

The key affiliate was Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. What's particularly striking to me is that Northern Pacific, which had a total market value of about $40 million when I first read about it, has evolved into part of BNSF, which Berkshire now fully owns. And here's the kicker - its successor now earns that entire original market value every four days. This example perfectly illustrates several key principles: first, how accounting rules can mask true value; second, how the market can dramatically undervalue assets; and third, how a long-term perspective on value can lead to extraordinary results.

I wrote about this back in 1975 in a memo to Kay Graham at The Washington Post Company, and the issues I highlighted then are even more relevant today. The real tragedy is that pension mathematics remains a mystery to most Americans, and that's dangerous. We're going to see a lot of bad news about public pension plans in the coming decade. The problem compounds over time, just like a tapeworm grows. When officials make pension promises without understanding or acknowledging the long-term funding requirements, they're essentially writing checks their taxpayers can't cash.

This lean efficiency is a core part of Berkshire's success formula. We don't need layers of bureaucracy or hundreds of corporate staff when we have the right people who bring both capability and dedication to their work."
