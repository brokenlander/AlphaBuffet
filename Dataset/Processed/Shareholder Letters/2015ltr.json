        "value": "Well, this is really about the evolution of Berkshire and how accounting rules work. You see, in our early days, book value was actually a pretty good proxy for our intrinsic value because most of our assets were in marketable securities that got marked to market prices. But here's what happened: we shifted our focus to owning entire businesses outright, and that's when book value started becoming less meaningful. The accounting rules for controlled companies are quite different from those for marketable securities. Let me explain why: when we make mistakes - and believe me, I've made some dumb purchases - we have to write down the value of those losers. That's fair enough. But here's the catch - when we have winners, and we've had some very big ones, we can't write those up by even a penny. It's a one-way street. So over time, this asymmetrical treatment, while we agree with it from an accounting standpoint, creates this growing gap between what shows up on our books and what the business is really worth. Today, we're sitting on large and growing unrecorded gains in our winners that aren't reflected in the book value at all. That's why Berkshire's intrinsic value is now far higher than what you see in the books."

        "value": "When we started out 51 years ago, our approach was quite different from what it is today. In those early years, we were primarily focused on marketable securities - stocks that we could buy and sell in the market. That's why our net worth back then was pretty close to our intrinsic value, because these securities were regularly revalued to their quoted market prices, minus the taxes we'd have to pay if we sold them. What Wall Street would call 'marked to market.' But by the early 1990s, we made a significant shift in our strategy. Instead of just buying pieces of businesses through the stock market, we started focusing on buying entire businesses outright. This was a fundamental change in how we deployed our capital. This shift had major implications for how our value is measured and reported. The rules for accounting for businesses we control are completely different from how we account for marketable securities. It's created this interesting situation where our book value, which used to be a pretty good yardstick of our worth, is now significantly understating our true value. Over these 51 years, we've grown book value from $19 to $155,501 per share, at a rate of 19.2% annually, but even that impressive figure doesn't tell the whole story of what Berkshire is worth today."

Over 13 consecutive years, we've not only generated underwriting profits - which means we're getting paid to hold other people's money - but we've also grown our float from $41 billion to $88 billion. Now, what's interesting about float is that while it technically doesn't belong to us and isn't reflected in our earnings, we can invest it for Berkshire's benefit. Think of it as a very large interest-free loan that, unlike a regular loan, has actually paid us $26 billion in underwriting profits to hold it. What makes this truly special is that we've spent 48 years building this operation, and you simply can't replicate that overnight. It's become our largest source of unrecorded wealth. The beauty of this model is that when we combine disciplined underwriting with intelligent investing of the float, we create a powerful economic engine that keeps generating value for Berkshire year after year."

What Charlie and I really like about bolt-ons is that they allow us to deploy capital into operations that already fit with our existing businesses. The key here is that these acquisitions are managed by our existing corps of expert managers - people who already know the business inside and out. That means no additional work for Charlie and me, but more earnings for Berkshire. Now, we're very particular about price - most deals that come our way are definitely not sensibly priced, and we pass on those. But when we find the right fit at the right price, it's a combination we find highly appealing. Looking ahead, we expect to make many dozens more of these bolt-on deals. It's a strategy that has served us well and will continue to be an important part of how we grow our subsidiaries."

We focus on buying businesses that are already well-run by cost-conscious and efficient managers. We don't go in looking to make dramatic changes or slash costs. Instead, our role is to create an environment where these CEOs - and their future successors who typically share the same mindset - can maximize both their effectiveness and job satisfaction. You know, Charlie Munger has this wonderful saying that I always keep in mind: 'If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure to marry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.' That's exactly what we try to avoid in business. We maintain an extremely decentralized structure - almost unheard of in corporate America. This is quite different from others, like Jorge Paulo's approach, where they look for companies with unnecessary costs that can be eliminated and then move quickly to make those changes. Both approaches can work - they've been extraordinarily successful with theirs - but at Berkshire, we prefer to avoid bloat from the start by buying businesses that already have the right cost culture in place."

When we talk about productivity, we're really talking about getting more output of desired goods and services per working hour. Without these gains, an economy inevitably stagnates - that's just an economic reality. Now, at Berkshire, we pursue productivity through what I'd call a preventative approach rather than a corrective one. We detest bureaucracy and crave efficiency, but instead of buying companies with the intent to eliminate waste, we look for businesses that already have their house in order. Take PCC for example - they've long been run by cost-conscious and efficient managers. That's what we look for. There are certainly different paths to achieving productivity gains. Some, like Jorge Paulo and his associates, are very successful at identifying companies with unnecessary costs and quickly making the changes needed to boost productivity. That's a perfectly valid approach, and there are indeed major productivity gains possible at much of corporate America. But our path is different - we prefer to maintain productivity through extreme decentralization and by partnering with managers who already have a proven track record of efficient operations."

Now, I'll acknowledge that some hostile offers can be justified. You see, there are cases where CEOs either forget they work for shareholders or are simply not up to the job. And sometimes boards are either blind to these problems or just reluctant to make needed changes. But here's our position: we'll leave those situations for others to handle. We prefer to operate through extreme decentralization and work with partners like Jorge Paulo where we can be either a financing partner, as we were with Tim Horton's, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, like with Heinz. We've also had successful partnerships with others, as we've shown at Berkadia. But the key principle remains - we're only interested in friendly acquisitions. That's fundamental to how we operate at Berkshire, and it's not going to change."

When you look at our Big Four - American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo - what might appear as small percentage changes actually translate into substantial earnings for Berkshire. For every one percentage point increase in our ownership across these four companies, Berkshire's portion of their annual earnings goes up by about $500 million. That's why we've been consistently increasing our positions - we went from 7.8% to 8.4% in IBM, 9.4% to 9.8% in Wells Fargo, and our ownership also grew in Coca-Cola from 9.2% to 9.3% and in American Express from 14.8% to 15.6% through their stock repurchases. These might look like small moves on paper, but when you understand the earnings impact, you see why we pay such close attention to these percentage changes.

I like to say it's better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone. Let me show you the mathematics of why this matters so much. For our four major investees, every single percentage point increase in our ownership raises Berkshire's portion of their annual earnings by about $500 million. These companies have returns on tangible equity that range from excellent to staggering. Just look at our portion of the 'Big Four's' 2015 earnings - it amounted to $4.7 billion. Now, we only report the dividends they pay us in our earnings, which was about $1.8 billion that year. But those unreported earnings - nearly $3 billion worth - are just as valuable to us as what we report. They're often used for stock repurchases, which increases our share of future earnings without us spending a dime, or they fund advantageous business opportunities. That's why we're perfectly happy being patient, long-term owners of these exceptional businesses."

      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "The key thing to understand here is that reported earnings don't tell the whole story. Let me explain why. When our investee companies retain their earnings instead of paying them out as dividends, those earnings create value for us in two important ways. First, these companies often use retained earnings to repurchase their own stock. This automatically increases Berkshire's share of future earnings without requiring us to spend any additional capital - it's like getting a bigger slice of the pie without buying more pie. Second, these retained earnings fund business opportunities that typically turn out to be advantageous. Now, while we only report the dividend portion in our earnings - which was about $1.8 billion last year from our 'Big Four' investments - the nearly $3 billion in retained earnings are every bit as valuable to us as what we report. Over time, this leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these investees will grow substantially. When those gains materialize, we benefit in two ways: our dividend income increases, and our unrealized capital gains grow. So while these retained earnings might not be immediately visible in our reported numbers, they're quietly working to create value for Berkshire shareholders."

        "value": "Well, I've always believed that flexibility is a huge competitive advantage in business. At Berkshire, we're willing to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses, which gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to only operating acquisitions. You know, I like to use that Woody Allen quote about being bi-sexual doubling your chances for a Saturday night date - and while it's not exactly the same thing, our willingness to go both ways with investments - either operating businesses or passive holdings - doubles our chances of finding smart ways to deploy Berkshire's constant flow of cash. It's really quite simple: why limit yourself? Plus, having that large portfolio of marketable securities serves another purpose - it's like having a stockpile of funds ready to go when we spot an elephant-sized acquisition opportunity. So this flexibility serves us in multiple ways: more opportunities, better capital allocation, and ready reserves for big moves. That's why we've structured Berkshire to maintain this flexibility rather than boxing ourselves into just one investment approach."

Politicians love to go on and on about our country's problems, claiming they're the only ones who can fix them. But here's the reality: the notion that our children won't live as well as their parents is absolutely wrong. Dead wrong. Look at the numbers - American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. To put that in perspective, that's six times higher, in real terms, than it was in 1930 when I was born. That's not just progress - that's a stunning leap that my parents' generation couldn't have even imagined. And here's what's fascinating - Americans today aren't inherently smarter than Americans in 1930, and they don't work any harder. We've simply gotten better at harnessing our potential. That's why I say the babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history. They're being born into a system that continues to generate unprecedented prosperity and opportunity.

But here's the reality: Our population grows about 0.8% annually - that's 0.5% from births minus deaths and 0.3% from migration. So that 2% overall growth translates to about 1.2% per capita growth. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Thanks to the magic of compounding - and I've always been a big believer in compounding - over just one generation of 25 years, this creates a 34.4% gain in real GDP per capita. Let me put that in dollar terms that everyone can understand: it means a $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation. For a family of four, that's $76,000 annually. So when people bemoan 2% growth, they're missing the bigger picture. The compounding effect makes this seemingly small percentage into something quite remarkable. And remember, we're achieving this without Americans being intrinsically smarter or working harder than their predecessors - we're just working more efficiently."

It's far beyond anything my parents or their contemporaries could have imagined. Here's what's fascinating about this progress: it's not because Americans today are smarter or work harder than Americans did in 1930. The secret is that we work far more efficiently and produce far more as a result. I can give you a tangible example of this progress that I see every day. In my upper middle-class neighborhood, the families there routinely enjoy a better standard of living than John D. Rockefeller Sr. had when I was born - and he was the richest person in the world at that time. This shows you the real power of America's economic progress.

First, there's our per-share cash and investments - which in 2015 increased 8.3% to $159,794, with our Kraft Heinz shares marked at market value. Second, we consider the earnings from our many businesses, including insurance underwriting income, which grew 2.1% to $12,304 per share. Now, it's important to understand that when we calculate these earnings, we're very thorough - we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization and minority interests. And we're careful not to double-count - we specifically exclude dividends and interest from our investments in that earnings figure. There's also a third, qualitative element that we discussed in our 2010 annual report.

You see, in the P/C business, we receive premiums upfront but pay claims later - sometimes much later. This timing difference creates what we call float, which is essentially money that we're holding that will eventually go to others. Now, here's the wonderful part - while we're holding this float, we get to invest it for our own benefit. And as our insurance business has grown, so has our float. Just look at the numbers: we went from $39 million in float in 1970 to $87,722 million in 2015. That's quite a growth story. Think of it as having access to a very large amount of money that we can invest, even though we'll eventually have to pay it back. The stability of float is also important - while individual policies and claims come and go, the total amount of float tends to remain fairly stable relative to our premium volume. That predictability makes it even more valuable to us as a source of investment capital."

However, we have to consider National Indemnity's reinsurance division, which is party to a number of run-off contracts where the float is gradually declining. Now, if we do experience a decline in float - and this is important - it would be very gradual. We're talking about no more than 3% in any year at the absolute outside. This is the reality we're dealing with after growing from a mere $39 million in 1970 to over $87 billion in 2015. Remember, National Indemnity has become the largest property-casualty company in the world by net worth, and its intrinsic value far exceeds its book value.

When our premiums exceed our total expenses and eventual losses, we get an underwriting profit on top of the investment income from our float. That's the ideal scenario - we get to use free money and actually get paid for holding it. But here's the rub - and it's a big one: Every insurer wants this favorable outcome. That creates intense competition in the industry, so intense that it often pushes the entire P/C industry into significant underwriting losses. What's happening is that the industry is essentially paying for the privilege of holding that float. Now, you combine this with the current prolonged period of low interest rates, and you've got a real challenge. These low rates mean that earnings on float will keep decreasing for years to come. That's why I'm fairly confident in saying that industry results over the next decade will likely fall short of the past decade's performance, especially for reinsurance specialists. It's just the nature of the competitive dynamics - they almost guarantee the insurance industry will continue earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth compared to other American businesses."

This isn't by accident - it's by design and represents a fundamental pillar of Berkshire's economic fortress. Even in our reinsurance division at National Indemnity, where we have some run-off contracts with declining float, we've structured things so any decrease would be very gradual - no more than 3% in any year. This conservative approach to float management is absolutely central to our operation, and I want to emphasize this point: It will never be compromised. We've built this structure specifically to ensure stability and long-term strength. While other insurers might face more volatile situations, we've intentionally created a system that protects us from sudden demands or dramatic float fluctuations. This stability is what allows us to maintain our economic strength even during challenging periods in the insurance market."

Think of it this way: Every day, we're paying out claims - in fact, we paid $24.5 billion to over six million claimants in 2015. But simultaneously, we're writing new business that generates new float to replace what we've paid out. If you're running your insurance operation properly - and at Berkshire, disciplined risk evaluation is a religion, Old Testament style - and your float is both costless and long-enduring, then the true value of this 'liability' is dramatically less than what the accounting shows. Here's the key distinction: owing $1 that will effectively never leave your premises because new business keeps replacing it is entirely different from owing $1 that you have to pay out tomorrow with no replacement. That's why understanding float's true nature is essential to understanding insurance economics."

This will be particularly tough for companies specializing in reinsurance. Now, at Berkshire, we've managed to operate at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive years, with pre-tax gains totaling $26.2 billion. But that's not luck - it's because we maintain absolute discipline in our risk evaluation. While everyone in the industry talks about disciplined underwriting, at Berkshire it's not just talk - it's a fundamental principle we live by. We understand that while float is valuable, its benefits can be completely wiped out by poor underwriting results. That's why our insurance managers focus on disciplined risk evaluation every single day."

I'll give you an example - if an insurance company runs large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill on their books becomes worthless, regardless of what they originally paid for it. Fortunately, that's not Berkshire's situation at all. In fact, Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill - what we would happily pay to acquire float of similar quality today - is far higher than its historic carrying value on our books. Consider this: almost all of that $15.5 billion goodwill was already on our books back in 2000, yet we've managed to triple our float since then.

But here's the kicker - the fourth one is where many insurers stumble: you must be willing to walk away when you can't get the right premium. You see, this last discipline is really where the rubber meets the road. I've watched too many insurers pass the first three tests with flying colors but then completely flunk the fourth one. They get caught up in that dangerous mindset of 'well, our competitors are writing this business, so we have to do it too.' That's a recipe for disaster in any business, but it's particularly toxic in insurance. Just look at our operation at General Re under Tad Montross - by following all four disciplines, especially that crucial fourth one, they've managed to turn their float into a better-than-cost-free operation.

Take Tad Montross's management of General Re - he's demonstrated exactly what good insurance leadership looks like. By strictly adhering to those four fundamental disciplines I mentioned earlier, he turned things around dramatically. The proof is in the results: under his leadership, General Re's enormous float has become considerably better than cost-free, and we expect that performance to continue on average. I'm particularly pleased with how the international life reinsurance business has grown - it's been consistently profitable since our 1998 acquisition. It's similar to what we've seen with Ajit Jain, who Mike Goldberg brilliantly put in charge of our reinsurance business. Ajit has since created tens of billions in value for our shareholders.

What GEICO had - and still has - is a structural cost advantage that allows them to offer lower prices while maintaining profitability.

When Berkshire acquired control in 1995, GEICO had 2.5% market share. By the end of 2015, that grew to 11.4%.

Now, this brings us to regulation, which is absolutely critical in these businesses. We place a lot of trust in future regulation, and I'll tell you why that's not just blind faith. First, society will always - and I mean always - need massive investments in transportation and energy. That's not going away. Second, it's in the government's own interest to treat capital providers fairly. If they don't, the money for essential projects simply won't flow. But there's another side to this coin - we need to operate in a way that keeps regulators and the public happy. One of our most powerful tools for doing this is keeping prices low. Take BHE in Iowa - we charge 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour while others in the region charge much more. The national average is 10.4 cents.

That's at least 40% lower than our major U.S.-based railroad competitors, who range from 4.2 to 5.3 cents. Now, you might wonder how we manage this while still making those $11.6 billion in infrastructure investments. The answer lies in our long-term perspective and operational efficiency. We understand that keeping prices low builds trust with both regulators and customers. This creates a virtuous circle - reasonable regulation allows us to make necessary investments, which helps us maintain efficiency and competitive prices, which in turn keeps our constituencies happy.

In 51 years of running businesses, I've never found a way to keep our operations competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge. Take our railroad business as an example - the depreciation we record at BNSF actually falls short of what we need to spend just to keep the railroad running properly. This creates a situation where GAAP earnings look higher than the true economic earnings. So when someone tries to exclude depreciation from their analysis, they're essentially ignoring very real costs that businesses must incur to stay competitive. The analysts who promote these misleading numbers might be doing it to maintain access to management or because everyone else is doing it, but that doesn't make it right.

The depreciation we're recording simply doesn't capture the full capital outlays needed to keep the railroad operating properly. This isn't unique to us - it's true for all railroads.

The best businesses in our portfolio can generate after-tax returns of 25% or even well over 100% - those are the ones with truly terrific economics. Then we have a solid middle group producing good returns between 12% and 20%. But I have to be straight with you - I've made some serious mistakes where businesses perform poorly. These mistakes typically come from two sources: Either I misread the economic dynamics of the company or industry, or I made poor judgments about management - both existing leaders and ones I appointed. Look, I'm going to make more mistakes - that's just part of the job of capital allocation. What we hope for is that these mistakes happen in our smaller operations where they do less damage. But when you look at our manufacturing, service and retailing operations as a whole, they're still excellent businesses. In 2015, they earned 18.4% after-tax on $25.6 billion of net tangible assets, even while holding excess cash and using minimal leverage.

But here's how we think about it: If a business has truly excellent economics - let's say it's earning 25% or more after-tax on unleveraged net tangible assets - we can justify paying a premium because those superior returns compound over time. However, we have to be very careful in our analysis. We need to be confident that those economics are sustainable and that we truly understand the business dynamics. Even a wonderful business can be a poor investment if you pay too much. That's why we look at the total picture - the quality of the business economics, the sustainability of those returns, and the price we're paying relative to what we're getting. When we look at our manufacturing, service and retailing operations as a group, we're getting a decent return on our deployed capital, even after accounting for those premiums we've paid.

These banks would bundle up these mortgages into incredibly complicated securities and sell them to unsuspecting institutions worldwide. But here's where it got even worse - and this really shows you what happens when Wall Street gets too 'innovative.' Some clever investment bankers created a second layer of securities based on the riskiest parts of the original offerings. I've said before that to properly evaluate just one of these securities, an investor would need to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing documentation. The fundamental problem was that neither the originator nor the packager had any skin in the game. They were simply focused on volume and mark-ups.

You see, I believe mortgage origination practices matter enormously, not just for the individual borrower but for society as a whole. We learned the hard way in 2008 what happens when these practices go wrong. That's why we take such care to make sure our customers understand their options and aren't pushed into any particular financing arrangement.

The industry standard now being discussed is this modest 1% to 5% retention rate, which Barney Frank correctly identified as insufficient when implementing Dodd-Frank. At Clayton, we take a completely different approach - we retain 100% of the risk on the mortgages we originate, except for those few that qualify for government guarantees. This means when we make mistakes in granting credit, we pay a hefty price. Just last year, we had to foreclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages, costing us $157 million. That's real money, and it dwarfs any profit we might have made on the original home sales.

Then you had borrowers who were blatantly lying on their loan applications while mortgage originators conveniently looked the other way. The gamiest credits - the riskiest loans - actually generated the most profits, which completely inverted the proper risk-reward relationship. Wall Street salesmen were making millions annually by creating products so complex their customers couldn't even understand them. And I have serious doubts about whether even the major rating agencies could properly evaluate these complex structures, though they went ahead and rated them anyway. The whole system was built on this foundation of misaligned incentives and lack of accountability. When nobody has to live with the consequences of their lending decisions, you're practically guaranteeing poor outcomes."

But here's the key point: While we've dramatically reduced the human input, our output has skyrocketed. Take corn, for instance. We're using slightly less land - about 85 million acres versus 90 million in 1900 - but we're producing about five times as much corn, going from 2.7 billion bushels to 13-14 billion bushels annually. The really important part that many Americans don't fully grasp is what this means for our broader society. Those tens of millions of people who would have been farming in the old system? They're now free to work in other sectors, producing all sorts of goods and services that we simply couldn't have had otherwise. This reallocation of human resources is what allows Americans today to enjoy a standard of living that would have been unimaginable in 1900.

That five-fold improvement came from innovations in five key areas that I specifically note: planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization, and seed quality. Each of these areas saw revolutionary changes. What's particularly interesting about this progression is how each innovation built upon previous ones, creating a compound effect. Think about it - better irrigation makes improved seeds more effective, better planting methods make fertilization more efficient, and so on. The results speak for themselves: we're now producing 13-14 billion bushels of corn annually compared to 2.7 billion in 1900, and we're doing it with fewer acres and far fewer workers.

That's not just good for those workers - it's been tremendously beneficial for our entire society. Think about it: because we don't need everyone working on farms anymore, Americans today can enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services that simply wouldn't exist otherwise. Now, I understand that if you were a farm hand who lost your job to a machine, talk about the 'greater good' probably didn't mean much to you at that moment. As I like to say - and this is a bit of humor here - it was probably fortunate that horses couldn't vote back then.

Now, here's what's remarkable: by 2014, Class I railroads were actually moving far more freight - 1.85 trillion ton-miles compared to 655 billion in 1947, an increase of 182%. But here's the kicker - they were doing all that additional work with just 187,000 workers, which represents an 86% reduction in workforce since 1947. While some of that reduction came from the passenger side, most of it was in freight operations. This kind of transformation hasn't been unique to railroads - it's been happening throughout American business. It's a prime example of how technological advancement and improved efficiency can dramatically increase output while requiring fewer workers. This pattern of doing more with less has been one of the defining features of American business evolution, and it's something we've seen across many of our Berkshire subsidiaries."

And believe me, some CEOs actually operated that way. Why? Because they were typically the sole supplier in their area and were guaranteed a certain return on their capital, regardless of how efficiently they operated. Even a 'sloppy' operation could do just fine financially. But that's all changing now. Society has made a clear choice to support renewable energy through federal subsidies, particularly wind and solar generation. These tax credits make renewables price-competitive in certain areas, and this government-mandated support for renewables can erode the economics of traditional utilities, especially if they're high-cost operators. That's why I'm particularly pleased with BHE's long-standing emphasis on efficiency. We didn't wait for competition to force our hand - we built that efficiency-focused culture early on.

That's extraordinary in this industry. In fact, no other investor-owned utility in America comes close to matching our enthusiasm for reinvestment. We believe in plowing our earnings back into the business to make it stronger and more efficient.

But here's the tough part - and we saw this firsthand at Berkshire - workers face a very different equation. When I look at what happened at our Dexter shoe operation in Maine, we lost our investment, but 1,600 workers lost something far more precious - their livelihoods. Many of these folks were at a stage in life where learning a new trade just wasn't realistic. We saw the same thing play out more slowly at our New England textile operations.

Take an event that has only a one-in-thirty chance of happening in a year. Over a century, that same event has a 96.6% chance of occurring at least once. That's just mathematics. Now, in today's world, we face risks that have grown exponentially during my lifetime. The means of inflicting maximum damage have increased dramatically - that's the dark side of innovation. Here's the cold, hard truth for investors: there's simply no way for American corporations or their investors to completely shed this risk. If we experience an event leading to mass devastation in the U.S., the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated. As Einstein aptly put it in 1949, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.' That's a sobering thought, but it's one we have to factor into our long-term thinking about risk."

Now, notice I say 'highly likely' rather than 'certain' - and there's a reason for that. I have no scientific aptitude, and I well remember how many 'experts' made dire predictions about Y2K that didn't materialize. But here's the key point I want to emphasize: it would be foolish for anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger. This is really about risk assessment and reasonable action. When we're facing potentially severe consequences, even if we're not entirely certain about all the details, waiting for absolute proof before taking any action isn't a prudent approach. It's similar to how we think about insurance - you don't wait until your house is on fire to buy fire insurance. You act on the possibility of risk, even if you're not certain the risk will materialize."

You see, Pascal argued that even if there's only a tiny probability that God exists, it makes sense to behave as if He does because the potential rewards are infinite while the downside of disbelief could be eternal misery. I apply similar thinking to climate change. While I'm not a scientist - and I remember how many experts were wrong about Y2K - we don't need 100% certainty to take action. If there's even a 1% chance we're heading toward a truly major disaster, and delay means passing a point of no return, failing to act now would be foolhardy. That's why I've come to call this Noah's Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear. You don't need perfect information when the potential consequences are severe enough. It's about rational risk management in the face of uncertainty, particularly when the downside could be catastrophic."

While some might worry that we're especially threatened by climate change because we're a huge insurer covering all sorts of risks, our business model actually provides significant protection. You see, we write policies for one year and reprice them annually to reflect changing exposures. This means that as risks increase - whether from climate change or any other factor - we can adjust our premiums accordingly. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums. This is fundamentally different from if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices, which would leave us exposed to long-term risks we couldn't reprice. So while we take climate risk seriously, our insurance business is structured to adapt to changing risk landscapes rather than being locked into fixed-price commitments over long periods."

        "value": "Well, let me explain this apparent paradox using GEICO as an example. Back in 1951, when I first got excited about GEICO, they were paying about $30 per policy in losses annually. Today, that number is around $1,000 per policy. Now, at first glance, that might sound terrible - like we're losing 33 times more money. But here's the key thing: as these costs go up due to inflation - whether it's more expensive car parts or higher medical bills - we can and do adjust our premiums accordingly. The beautiful thing is that these higher loss costs actually translate directly into higher premiums, which means more float and a bigger business overall. Just look at the numbers - if costs had stayed at 1951 levels, we'd be running a $600 million auto insurance business today. Instead, GEICO is doing $23 billion in business. So what might look like a problem - rising costs - has actually helped make insurance companies far more valuable. It's one of those counterintuitive things in business where what seems bad on the surface has actually worked to our advantage."

Here's why: Up to now, we haven't seen climate change produce more frequent or more costly hurricanes or other weather-related events that insurance covers. In fact, we've seen super-cat rates falling steadily in recent years - that's actually why we've reduced our exposure to that business. Now, here's something interesting to consider - if super-cats do become costlier and more frequent in the future, the likely effect on Berkshire's insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable. That's because increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums. Now, don't misunderstand me - as a citizen, climate change might legitimately keep you up at night. If you're a homeowner in a low-lying area, you might want to think about moving. But when you're wearing your shareholder hat and thinking strictly about the insurance business, climate change isn't something that should concern you from a business perspective."

You see, we don't play favorites with big institutional investors or analysts - we don't do those private one-on-one meetings that many companies do. The small shareholder who's trusted us with their savings is just as important to us as any large institution. In fact, I'd say they're more important. That's why we structure our information releases and our annual meeting the way we do. It's about fairness and giving everyone a level playing field. When someone entrusts you with their savings, you have an obligation to treat them right, and that starts with equal access to information."

They have what I believe to be the most shareholder-oriented approach you'll find anywhere in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. When you have managers who think like owners and treat the business as their own family's asset, you get a different level of care and commitment. That's why I regularly praise their accomplishments. They're not just running divisions of a big company; they're nurturing and growing businesses as if their family's entire future depended on it. This owner's mentality is absolutely crucial to our success at Berkshire, and it's something we look for and cultivate in our managers."

Then we have our corporate office team - 24 incredible individuals who make everything run smoothly. They handle an enormous workload - imagine filing a 30,400-page federal tax return and 3,530 state returns! They manage SEC requirements, shareholder communications, our annual meeting preparations, and countless other tasks with remarkable efficiency. What makes them truly special is how they do it all cheerfully while making my life easier. You know, no CEO has it better than I do. These people are a big reason why I literally feel like tap dancing to work every day. When you have teams that dedicated and talented, it just makes the whole enterprise work beautifully."

For instance, last year they coordinated with 40 universities - selected from 200 applicants - to organize a Q&A day with students. That's not something you'd find in a standard corporate job description. They handle my personal requests, arrange my travel, and even make sure I get my hamburgers and french fries for lunch - with Heinz ketchup, of course! This kind of dedication and willingness to go the extra mile is what makes our corporate culture special. They're not just doing a job; they're helping to create the unique character of Berkshire. It's part of why our business keeps growing - we saw revenues increase by $16 billion in 2015 - and why my job becomes more fun every year."

You won't find many companies our size with that kind of stability and lean operation at headquarters. We've never had to announce 'restructuring' charges because we don't play that game of over-hiring and then laying people off. When we bring someone on board, it's because there's real work to be done, and we make sure we get the right person who fits our culture and wants to be part of our long-term story.

No turnover, no constant shuffling of personnel, no bloated management structure. Most large companies you look at, they're constantly announcing restructuring charges, which is really just code for 'we hired too many people and now we have to let them go.' At Berkshire, we've never had to do that because we follow a simple rule - we only hire someone when there's genuine work to be done, and we make sure we hire wonderful people who want to stay for the long haul. That's why I invite shareholders to come to Omaha - the cradle of capitalism - and meet this gang themselves. They're the best at what they do, and they prove that you don't need a massive headquarters staff to run a successful enterprise."
