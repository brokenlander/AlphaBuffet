        "value": "Well, this is really about the peculiarities of GAAP accounting rules and how they affect our reported numbers. You see, when we buy businesses - and we've bought quite a few over the years - the accounting rules require us to write down the value when we've clearly made a mistake and overpaid. And believe me, I've made some doozies in my time, paying far too much for goodwill that later had to be written off. But here's the interesting part - when we have winners, and we've had some very big winners, we can't write those up by even a penny. It's like a marriage - you get some surprises after saying 'I do.' The difference is that in accounting, you only have to acknowledge the bad surprises, never the good ones. This creates an asymmetry that, over time, makes our book value diverge significantly from our intrinsic value. Today, we have huge unrecorded gains, particularly in our property/casualty insurance business, that aren't reflected in our book value. That's why our market price gain over 52 years has substantially exceeded our book value gain - because stock prices eventually gravitate toward intrinsic value."

This ties directly into how we think about business value versus accounting numbers. We're not focused on the accounting vagaries that might make our book value jump around. Instead, we're looking at the true economic value - what we call intrinsic value - of our businesses. When we acquire companies, we're looking for ones that will contribute to this growing earning power. Now, sometimes we've made mistakes in assessing that value - paying too much for economic goodwill that didn't pan out. But we've also had some tremendous winners that have dramatically increased our earning power, even though their full value isn't reflected in our books. The key is to understand that accounting rules, while necessary, don't always capture the real economics of a business. That's why we focus on intrinsic value and growing our true earning power, rather than just watching the accounting numbers."

In fact, in both 2015 and 2016, we ranked first among all American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained - we're talking many billions more than the runner-up. But here's the key thing: those retained dollars must earn their keep. We don't just sit on them. As stewards of your capital, Charlie and I have a responsibility to ensure these reinvested earnings create value. Now, we don't have any magic formula for this. Our approach is surprisingly simple: we dream big and stay prepared, both mentally and financially, to act quickly when opportunities show up. Sometimes these opportunities come during those periodic downpours - what I like to call those times when dark clouds fill the economic skies and briefly rain gold. When those moments come, we need to be ready with washtubs, not teaspoons. That's why we maintain our financial strength and keep our powder dry."

But let me be perfectly candid about this: the actual earnings won't always follow a smooth path. There are several reasons for this. First, you've got the periodic weaknesses in the U.S. economy - that's just part of the business cycle we have to deal with. Then there are industry-specific events and insurance mega-catastrophes that can temporarily knock our earnings down, even when most American businesses are doing fine. Some years, our gains in underlying earning power will be modest - that's just reality. But here's what's important: our job is to deliver significant growth over time, whether it's bumpy or not. We've actually been evolving as a company, gradually shifting from getting most of our gains from investment activities to growing value through owning businesses. The key is to maintain a long-term perspective and understand that progress isn't always linear."

We paid $434 million in Berkshire stock - specifically 25,203 shares - for a business that promptly went to zero. Now, here's the real kicker: those shares would be worth over $6 billion today. You see, when you pay with cash and make a mistake, you lose 100% of what you paid. But when you pay with stock that's going to appreciate significantly, as Berkshire's has, you're effectively multiplying your error many times over. It's like paying for something worthless with a magic check that keeps growing larger every year. This is why I say it was far more than a simple bad business decision - it was a case where Berkshire shareholders gave far more than they received. And while the Bible might endorse giving more than you receive, I can tell you it's not a blessed practice when you're acquiring businesses. This experience really drove home the importance of being extremely careful when using your stock as currency, especially if you believe that stock is going to be worth substantially more in the future."

It represented our shift from being primarily an investment company to one focused on owning operating businesses. What made GEICO special was that it marked our transition from having it as a portfolio investment to making it a wholly-owned operating business. And let me tell you, GEICO has become the centerpiece around which we built what I believe is now the world's premier property/casualty business. It had what I call 'almost unlimited potential.' Now, contrast this with the General Re purchase in 1998. While General Re eventually became a fine insurance operation that we prize, the acquisition process itself was a terrible mistake. Why? Because we used Berkshire stock - 272,200 shares to be exact - which diluted our outstanding shares by 21.8%. This goes back to that principle I mentioned about using stock for purchases. Even though General Re turned out to be a good business, the way we paid for it was wrong. The key difference is that GEICO was a cash transaction that fit perfectly into our strategic vision, while General Re, despite its eventual success, came at too high a cost to our shareholders because we used our valuable stock as currency."

Since then, we've shifted dramatically in how we approach acquisitions. Just look at MidAmerican Energy - we bought that with cash in 2000, and it's been a fantastic investment that's opened up many profitable opportunities. That purchase really set us on our current three-part strategy: building our insurance operations, actively acquiring large and diverse non-insurance businesses, and - this is key - making these deals primarily with internally-generated cash. I'm so convinced about avoiding share issuance now that, as I like to say, I'd rather prep for a colonoscopy than issue Berkshire shares. The numbers tell the story - in the 18 years after 1999, our outstanding shares only grew by 8.3%, with most of that coming from the BNSF purchase, which I'll note was one of those rare cases where issuing stock made good sense."

First, we have our operating businesses, with our insurance operations being particularly important. Then we have our investment portfolio of bonds and stocks which, even though we've de-emphasized it somewhat, continues to grow and deliver substantial capital gains, interest, and dividends. What makes this system so effective is how these two prongs complement each other. The portfolio earnings have been tremendously helpful in financing our business purchases. While some might see this as overly complex, I view it as a real edge in the marketplace. It's like having two engines on an airplane - if one isn't performing at its peak, the other one helps keep us moving forward. This approach has served us particularly well since 1999 when we really began to redirect our business strategy. The key is that these two sources of capital give us flexibility and opportunities that other companies might not have, and that's what creates our competitive advantage."

In just 240 years - that's less than triple my lifetime - we've built something extraordinary. Starting from essentially nothing, we've accumulated $90 trillion in wealth. Look around you - 75 million homes, 260 million vehicles, world-class medical centers, outstanding universities. These aren't just numbers on a page. They represent real progress from the primitive structures and meager output of 1776. What's particularly clever about our system is how it preserves wealth even when individual owners struggle. If someone defaults on a loan, the asset doesn't vanish - it simply changes hands through our lending institutions to a new American owner. As Gertrude Stein aptly put it, 'Money is always there, but the pockets change.' That's the beauty of our market system - it not only creates abundance but also has built-in mechanisms to maintain and reallocate it efficiently."

Add to that our market system and the rule of law, and you've got something special. You don't need an economics degree to understand this. The proof is in the results we see all around us. We've created productive factories, built great medical centers, established talent-filled universities - all starting from scratch on what was essentially barren land in 1776. What's made this possible is our American system that combines human potential with strong institutions. The market system has been particularly crucial as the primary factor in allocating rewards. It's created an environment where talent and hard work can flourish, where capital finds its best use, and where innovation is rewarded. When you put all these elements together - human ingenuity, immigration, markets, and the rule of law - you get what I call the American miracle."

You know, it's interesting because people sometimes think it's just about having the smartest or most industrious population. But here's the key point - those early Americans weren't necessarily smarter or more hardworking than the people who came before them in other places. What made the difference was that they created a system that unleashed human potential. They built something special, and subsequent generations kept building on that foundation. This system doesn't just create wealth - it also helps allocate rewards effectively. Sure, we have government redistribution through taxation at various levels, but the fundamental engine is this market system. And despite occasional interruptions - which are inevitable in any system - this economic creation continues to deliver increasing wealth to future generations.

We've essentially created a system where those in their productive years help both the young and the old. Now, when people hear 'entitlements,' they typically think about programs for the elderly. But I want to point out something that often gets overlooked - we have another massive entitlement program that's absolutely crucial to our future: public education. Let me give you the numbers here because they're quite striking. Every year, four million American babies are born with an entitlement to a public education. That's not a small commitment - we're talking about roughly $150,000 per baby, adding up to more than $600 billion annually, or about 3.5% of GDP. This is primarily handled at the local level. Now, when we look at our national wealth more broadly, it's important to note that the vast majority belongs to Americans. Yes, foreigners own some portion, but it's relatively modest, and we actually own comparable assets abroad. So what we've created is a system that not only generates wealth but also includes specific mechanisms for investing in future generations through education while supporting our elderly. That's a pretty remarkable balance when you think about it."

But - and this is equally important - personal fear is your enemy. The trick is to recognize the difference. What I've learned over decades is that investors who simply maintain a collection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses and avoid high costs will almost certainly do well over time. It's really that simple. You don't need to do anything fancy. Just stay rational when others are fearful. Remember, personal fear is not only your enemy - it's also unwarranted. The American economy has faced countless panics and emerged stronger each time.

Having an additional buyer in the market is always better for a seller, even if the day-to-day impact might be small. But here's the critical part for continuing shareholders: repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought below intrinsic value. Let me give you a straightforward example we use at Berkshire. If you have three equal partners in a $3,000 business, and one is bought out for $900, each remaining partner gains $50 in intrinsic value immediately. It's just arithmetic. When companies follow this rule - buying below intrinsic value - the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic value. That's why at Berkshire, we're very careful about when and how we do repurchases. We're not interested in buying shares just to boost the stock price; we're interested in increasing per-share value for our continuing shareholders.

But if you overpay and spend $1,100, each continuing partner loses $50. The math works exactly the same way with corporate share repurchases. What puzzles me is that companies rarely specify a price ceiling above which they won't buy shares. That's not how we'd approach buying an outside business - price is always fundamental to the buy-or-pass decision. Yet when CEOs are buying pieces of their own company, they often seem to ignore price completely. Ask yourself: would these same executives be so price-insensitive if they were running a private company and buying out one of just a few owners? Of course not. The principle is clear - whether a buyback enhances or destroys value for continuing shareholders depends entirely on the price paid. It's that straightforward."

In these cases, if the company is also uncomfortable taking on additional debt, the internal needs for capital must take priority over share repurchases. Now, this comes with an important caveat - this exception only makes sense if the business has good prospects ahead of it after making these required investments. You see, it's about being rational with capital allocation. Just like we wouldn't buy an outside business if it left us short of operating capital, we shouldn't repurchase shares if it compromises the company's ability to fund its core operations and growth.

Now, this 120% threshold represents a significant discount to Berkshire's intrinsic value. We deliberately set it there because calculating intrinsic value isn't an exact science - you need that margin of safety. But here's what's important: this authorization doesn't mean we're going to artificially prop up the stock at that level. Instead, we try to balance two things: making meaningful purchases at value-creating prices while being careful not to over-influence the market.

This is something we at Berkshire faced quite often in our earlier days. I should note that at our current size, this second scenario rarely comes up for us anymore. But for other companies, these are vital considerations. The key is to be rational about capital allocation.

We don't want them too high, because we don't enjoy having disappointed owners who paid too much. And we don't particularly like buying out our partners at a discount - that's not the most satisfying way to make money. But if market circumstances create a situation where repurchases would benefit both our continuing and exiting shareholders, we'll be ready to act. The key is having a disciplined approach and being transparent about it. Some folks have criticized repurchases as being somehow un-American, suggesting they divert funds from productive investments.

Sometimes much later. In extreme cases, like with asbestos claims, we might not pay for decades. This collect-now, pay-later model means we're holding large sums of money that will eventually go to others. But here's the beautiful part - while we're holding this float, we get to invest it for our own benefit. And as our insurance business has grown, so has our float. Just look at the numbers: we went from $39 million in float in 1970 to over $100 billion recently. That's quite a growth story. Now, float isn't free money - we have to pay claims eventually - but when managed well, it's an extraordinary business model. We recently wrote a huge policy that pushed our float over $100 billion, though I should note that we may see some decline in float over time, particularly from National Indemnity's reinsurance run-off contracts. But operations like GEICO should continue to grow their float nicely."

The key attraction was, and still is, the fundamental structure of the business: you collect premiums upfront and pay claims later. This timing difference creates float, which we can invest for our benefit. It's a model that has served as the engine of Berkshire's growth since that initial purchase. While many might see insurance as a complex business, we saw it as a straightforward opportunity to create value through disciplined underwriting combined with smart investment of the float. That basic insight from 1967 has proven to be one of our most important business decisions."

Now, if our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we get what we call an underwriting profit on top of whatever investment income we generate from the float. That's really the ideal scenario - we're essentially getting paid to hold and invest other people's money. But here's the rub - and it's an important one - every insurance company wants this same wonderful result. This creates incredibly intense competition in the industry. In fact, the competition is so vigorous that it frequently pushes the property-casualty industry as a whole into significant underwriting losses. When that happens, insurers are effectively paying for the privilege of holding their float. At National Indemnity, we're seeing some of our large run-off contracts naturally declining, and we may experience a gradual decline in float - though never more than 3% in any year. This is all by design, and we're very careful about how we structure our insurance contracts to maintain our financial strength."

It's simply built into the structure of the industry. And now, this situation has been made even more difficult by the dramatically lower interest rates we're seeing throughout the world. Here's why that matters: most property-casualty companies - though not Berkshire, I should note - have their investment portfolios heavily concentrated in bonds. With interest rates at historic lows, these companies are earning far less on their float than they used to. So you have this double-whammy effect - intense competition forcing companies to sometimes operate at an underwriting loss just to maintain their float, and then those same companies earning lower returns on their investment portfolios due to the interest rate environment. It's a tough combination that makes it very difficult for the industry as a whole to generate satisfactory returns."

This means their earnings from float will steadily decline. But at Berkshire, we've positioned ourselves differently. We have unrivaled financial strength that gives us far more flexibility in how we invest. When other companies are constrained in their choices, our options actually expand. That's a tremendous advantage, and occasionally it presents us with major opportunities. It's like having multiple tools in your toolbox while others are limited to just a hammer. We can choose the right tool for the job at hand, and that's particularly valuable when markets present unusual conditions like we're seeing now.

Every one of our insurance managers focuses on this daily. You know, it's interesting - all insurance companies will tell you they're disciplined in their underwriting. They give it lip service. But at Berkshire, it's not just talk - it's a religion, Old Testament style. We're absolutely fundamental about it. Think about this: when we calculate Berkshire's book value, we deduct the full amount of our float as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and couldn't replenish it. That's a conservative approach, but it's part of our disciplined mindset. The float only creates value if we're smart about how we generate it through careful underwriting. That's why we've been able to maintain our track record of underwriting profits while building valuable float."

Think of it more like a revolving fund. Every day, we're paying out claims - in fact, we paid $27 billion to over six million claimants in 2016. But here's the key - we're simultaneously writing new business that generates new float to replace it. It's like a pool that's constantly being refreshed. If our float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, its true value is dramatically different from what the accounting liability suggests. Let me put it this way: owing $1 that will effectively never leave because new business keeps replacing it is completely different from owing $1 that you have to pay out tomorrow with no replacement. Yet GAAP accounting treats these two situations exactly the same way. That's why when you're evaluating Berkshire's intrinsic value, you need to think about float very differently from a typical liability."

But here's what's really important to understand - the original cost of that goodwill has absolutely nothing to do with its true value today. Let me give you a clear example: if an insurance company runs into trouble and starts having large, prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill on their books becomes worthless, regardless of what they originally paid for it. It's like buying a machine - what matters isn't what you paid for it, but whether it's still producing value today. Fortunately, that's not an issue at Berkshire. Our insurance operations continue to generate valuable float at a cost well below what we could borrow money for elsewhere.

Since then, we've grown that float by an additional $64 billion, but here's the important part - that tremendous increase isn't reflected anywhere in our book value. Now, when Charlie and I think about the true economic value of our insurance goodwill, we consider what we'd willingly pay to acquire float of similar quality. And I can tell you, that number is far above the historical carrying value on our books. This unrecorded asset is one of the main reasons - and I mean a huge reason - why Berkshire's intrinsic business value significantly exceeds its book value. But let me be clear - this only works because we're very disciplined about our insurance operations. If an insurance company is suffering large, ongoing underwriting losses, their goodwill wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on, regardless of its original cost.

That's not by accident. It starts with having terrific managers running disciplined operations with business models that are hard to replicate. Take Ajit Jain at our Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, for instance. He's willing to insure risks that others won't touch - not because we're reckless, but because we have the capacity and brains to evaluate them properly. Ajit combines capacity, speed, decisiveness, and most importantly, brains in a way that's unique in the insurance business.

First, you've got to understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses. You can't price what you don't understand - it's that simple. Second, you need to conservatively assess both the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and what that loss might cost you. Notice I emphasize 'conservatively' here - we're not in the business of optimistic guessing. Third, you must set a premium that will deliver a profit after covering both your expected loss costs and operating expenses. This isn't just about breaking even - we're running a business, not a charity. And fourth - and this might be the most important one - you have to be willing to walk away if you can't get the appropriate premium. This last point is where a lot of insurers get into trouble. They get caught up in chasing market share or premium volume and forget that it's better to write no business than to write bad business. These four principles have served us incredibly well at Berkshire, and they're a big reason why we've built such a successful insurance operation.

But here's where it gets interesting - the fourth discipline is having the willpower to walk away when you can't get the right premium. You see, this is where many insurers stumble. They pass the first three tests but fail miserably on the fourth. They get caught up in what I call the 'follow the herd' mentality. When they see their competitors writing certain business, they feel compelled to do the same. I've always said that the excuse 'the other guy is doing it, so we must as well' is trouble in any business, but it's absolutely poisonous in insurance. It's a recipe for disaster. This is why we've always emphasized having managers who understand this principle - people like Tad and Kara who won't cave to that kind of pressure."

Tony started at GEICO at age 18 and went on to spend 55 years with the company, becoming CEO in 1993. He brings three critical qualities that I believe are essential for success in this business: brilliance, dedication, and soundness. That last quality - soundness - is particularly crucial for sustained success. As Charlie likes to say, it's great to have a manager with a 160 IQ, unless he thinks it's 180. That's the kind of wisdom that separates truly great managers from the rest.

That low-cost structure creates what we call a moat - an enduring competitive advantage that competitors simply cannot cross. The proof is in the numbers: GEICO has grown from 2.5% market share in 1995, when Berkshire took control, to about 12% in 2016. Their employment went from 8,575 to 36,085 in that same period. The beauty of this model is that it's self-reinforcing. When insurance prices go up across the industry, people naturally shop around more. And when they shop, GEICO wins because of that fundamental cost advantage. It's really quite simple - they deserve to succeed because they save people money, and that's exactly what's happened.

You see, we have a philosophy at Berkshire - we like to make hay while the sun sets, knowing that it will surely rise again. This contrarian approach is possible because of GEICO's fundamental cost advantages. While others retreat, we can afford to be aggressive because our cost structure gives us more room to maneuver. This is particularly powerful because when insurance prices increase across the industry, consumers naturally become more price-conscious and shop around more. And remember what I said - when people shop, GEICO wins. It's a perfect example of turning what others see as a challenge into an opportunity for growth.

Then we have what I'd call our bread-and-butter operations - solid businesses generating good returns in the 12% to 20% range. Looking at our manufacturing, service and retailing group as a single entity, they're actually an excellent business overall. In 2016, they employed about $24 billion of net tangible assets and earned 24% after-tax on that capital, which is impressive considering they held large quantities of excess cash and very little debt. But here's the key thing to understand - a business with terrific economics can still be a bad investment if you pay too much for it. We've had to pay substantial premiums above net tangible assets for most of our businesses. You can see this reflected in the large goodwill figure on our balance sheet. The secret isn't just finding good businesses - it's finding good businesses at the right price."

Looking at our 2016 numbers, we had about $1.5 billion in GAAP amortization charges, but I estimate only about 20% of that represents real economic cost. The rest is essentially an accounting fiction. What happens is interesting - when these amortization charges fully write off the related asset, usually around the 15-year mark, our GAAP earnings will suddenly increase even though nothing has actually changed in our underlying business economics. That's why Charlie and I prefer to look at these figures differently than GAAP requires.

This became particularly evident during the high-inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s, when this topic was widely discussed. So we have this interesting situation where GAAP gives us one type of distortion with amortization - overstating costs - while simultaneously giving us another type of distortion with depreciation - understating costs. This is why Charlie and I always focus on trying to understand the true economics of our businesses rather than just accepting GAAP figures at face value.

The fundamental problem is that current replacement costs for many depreciable items in the railroad industry far exceed their historical costs. This isn't a new phenomenon - we saw similar issues during the high inflation period of the 1970s and early 1980s. While inflation became less of an issue after Paul Volcker's actions, this disparity between reported and economic earnings remains particularly significant in railroads. And it's not a short-term issue - this gap between GAAP depreciation and true economic costs will persist for decades. Despite this accounting reality, Charlie and I still love our railroad investment. The key is understanding that reported earnings throughout the railroad industry are considerably higher than true economic earnings.

When the CEO is openly looking for ways to report higher numbers, it creates a culture where everyone down the line tries to be 'helpful' in meeting those goals. This can lead to very dangerous practices. Take the insurance industry, for example - we've seen many companies destroy themselves by underestimating loss reserves just to make their numbers look better. What really makes us cringe is when we hear analysts praising managements who always 'make the numbers.' Let's be realistic - business is simply too unpredictable for any company to consistently meet exact targets. When surprises inevitably occur, a CEO who's overly focused on Wall Street expectations will be tempted to manipulate the numbers.

Now, there are legitimate cases - like when Kraft and Heinz merged - where major one-time costs need to be clearly explained to owners. That's different from routinely adjusting away normal business expenses. As for stock-based compensation, claiming it's not an expense is even more problematic. What these CEOs are essentially saying is, 'Don't worry about the cost of paying me in stock or options - I'll just adjust it away.' At Berkshire, we have hundreds of executives at our subsidiaries who receive comparable compensation, but we pay in cash and account for it properly.

But here's where many companies go wrong - they try to treat routine business adjustments as special items year after year. At Berkshire, if we ever had truly major expenses in a single year, I would certainly discuss it in my commentary to shareholders. But we don't play games by regularly asking investors to ignore normal business costs. Think about it this way - business adjustments are part of running any company.

Look, if you're using something of value to pay your employees - whether it's cash, stock, or golden tickets to Willy Wonka's factory - it's a cost. I've always believed that if CEOs want to exclude stock-based compensation from their earnings reports, they need to explain one of two things to their owners: either why items of value used to pay employees aren't a cost, or why this particular payroll cost should be treated differently than others. It reminds me of that story from the 1960s about the CEO interviewing auditors by asking 'What is two plus two?' The winning answer was 'What number do you have in mind?'

Some might joke that we lack imagination in our accounting, but I believe in calling a spade a spade. When we pay our managers, it's a real expense, and we report it as such. We don't try to dress up our earnings by pretending that part of what we pay our people isn't really a cost. It's simple, it's transparent, and it's honest.

In fact, I've recently added language to Principle 11 to make this crystal clear to our owners - any marketable security in our portfolio should be considered available for sale, even if such a sale might seem unlikely at present.

Now, on the dividend taxation front, here's something that might surprise many of our shareholders, especially those who think capital gains are always the most tax-efficient route: Berkshire, like most corporations, actually gets more benefit from a dollar of dividends than from a dollar of capital gains. The math is pretty straightforward - when a corporation realizes capital gains, it's looking at 35 cents of federal income tax on every dollar, plus potential state taxes on top of that.

That's why I was willing to put $500,000 on the line betting against any pro who wanted to pick five hedge funds to compete against a simple S&P index fund.

The fundamental flaw lies in what I'd call a 'heads I win, tails you lose' arrangement. These managers get their 2% fixed fee regardless of performance - they could lose huge amounts of money and still collect these fees. Then they get 20% of profits with no clawback provision, meaning if they have good years followed by bad ones, they don't have to give back their earlier profits.

That's why I made this the centerpiece of my bet on the Long Bets website - to demonstrate that even the most sophisticated active management approaches can't overcome the mathematical reality of costs. The S&P 500, with its minimal costs, simply had too great an advantage in this race."

Look at it this way - if you divide all investors into two groups - the active investors and the do-nothing investors - both groups together must achieve the market average before costs. That's just mathematical reality. So when you factor in the typically exorbitant costs of active management, that group is destined to underperform. I've been in this business my entire life, and I can tell you that in all those years, I've only identified about ten professionals who I believed would consistently beat the S&P over long periods. Now, I'm sure there are hundreds or maybe thousands of others out there who could do it - the job isn't impossible. But here's the key point - the probability that any particular manager soliciting your money will be one of those rare exceptions is very low. As my friend Bill Ruane wisely put it, 'In investment management, the progression is from the innovators to the imitators to the swarming incompetents.' That's exactly what we see playing out in the industry."

The reality is that over short periods, some investment professionals - just like some amateurs - will appear to be brilliant simply due to luck. It's similar to flipping coins - someone's bound to get a streak of heads. The key is to look at long-term, sustainable performance. In my experience spanning many decades, I've found that truly skilled investors are extremely rare. While I've been fortunate to identify about ten professionals early in their careers who I expected would outperform over the long haul, these were exceptional cases. The problem isn't that superior investment performance is impossible - it's that the vast majority who attempt it will fail. And here's what makes it even more complicated for the average investor: the person trying to sell you their investment services is very unlikely to be one of those rare exceptions who can consistently deliver superior results. That's why I emphasize looking at long-term track records and being extremely skeptical of short-term outperformance."

First, as my good friend Bill Ruane aptly put it, the investment world progresses 'from innovators to imitators to swarming incompetents.' But the real trick is that short-term success can be very misleading. Let me explain why: If you have 1,000 managers making market predictions, pure probability suggests that at least one will be right for nine straight years. It's no different than if you had 1,000 monkeys making predictions - you'd likely get one that appears to be a genius! The key difference is that people don't line up to invest with the lucky monkey. But with managers, they do, which leads to another problem. When someone does show good results - whether through skill or luck - they attract huge sums of money. And here's the catch: managing large sums is fundamentally different from managing smaller amounts. What works beautifully with millions often struggles terribly with billions. I learned this lesson early on - back in 1966, when I was managing just $44 million, I warned my partners about this very issue. The reality is that size is often the enemy of performance, but most managers keep seeking more funds anyway because their fees are tied to assets under management."

First, when a manager shows good performance, they attract a flood of new money - that's just human nature. People see success and want to be part of it. Second - and this is crucial - huge sums of money act like an anchor on investment performance. I always say that what's easy with millions becomes a real struggle with billions. It's simply a matter of scale and market impact. You can't dance in and out of positions when you're managing enormous sums without moving market prices against you. Third, despite knowing these limitations, most managers can't resist taking on more money because their fee structure is typically based on assets under management. The more money they manage, the more they earn. I recognized this pattern early in my career. In fact, back in 1966, when I was managing $44 million, I explicitly warned my partners that greater size was more likely to harm than help their results. Notice I said 'their' results, not my personal results - because as a manager, I could still make more money with larger sums, but that didn't mean it was best for my investors."

That's why I stopped taking new partners then. You see, when you have Wall Street managers handling trillions of dollars and charging high fees, it's usually the managers who end up with the outsized profits, not the clients. It's just simple mathematics. The bigger the assets under management and the higher the fees, the more the returns get eaten away. That's why I strongly believe both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds. The math simply doesn't work in your favor when you're paying high fees to active managers who, more often than not, fail to deliver added value. In fact, as our recent bet showed, many deliver less than nothing in added value. It's a hard truth that many in the investment management industry don't like to hear, but the evidence is clear: size and high fees are typically the enemies of investment performance."

What makes Jack particularly heroic is that he chose to help millions of investors earn better returns rather than accumulating vast personal wealth for himself. Think about this: while other fund managers were promising big rewards and delivering nothing - or less than nothing as our bet proved - Jack was actually helping people achieve better returns on their savings through low-cost indexing. He only amassed a tiny percentage of the wealth that typically flowed to other managers, but his impact has been enormous. Today, he has the satisfaction of knowing he's helped millions of investors keep more of their returns instead of paying them away in fees. That's why he's a hero to me and to countless others. His crusade for low-cost investing has probably done more to help American investors than anyone else in history."

You see, wealthy investors often have this deeply ingrained belief that their money should buy them something superior to what the average person gets. They're used to getting the best of everything - the finest food, top schools, premium entertainment, you name it. So when it comes to investing, they just can't bring themselves to buy the same financial product that's available to someone investing only a few thousand dollars. Instead, they go running to high-fee managers or consultants who speak in fancy gibberish and recommend complicated strategies. It's a perfect example of how human nature - specifically this desire to feel special or superior - can lead even very smart people to make suboptimal financial decisions. The irony is that by trying to get something 'exclusive,' they often end up with something inferior to the simple, low-cost option available to everyone."

So instead, they create job security by recommending small managerial shifts every year or so. They dress up these recommendations in what I call 'esoteric gibberish,' using fancy terms to explain why certain investment 'styles' or current economic trends make these shifts necessary. And here's the key - large fees flow to these consultants for making these complicated-sounding recommendations. It's a system that perpetuates itself because the wealthy clients get to feel like they're getting sophisticated, exclusive advice, and the consultants get to keep collecting their fees. But in reality, all this complexity and constant shifting around often just detracts from what would likely be better long-term results with a simple index fund approach. It's a classic case of the investment industry making things more complicated than they need to be, primarily to justify their own existence and fees."

They've been hit with what I call a double whammy: poor investment performance plus huge fees. And who pays for this? The local taxpayers will be making up these shortfalls for decades to come.

Even when the simpler product is clearly the better choice on an expectancy basis, they resist it. It's a cycle that keeps repeating itself.

They know these wealthy clients and institutions will continue to believe they deserve something 'extra' in investment advice. It's remarkable how consistent this behavior is.

But equally important - and I want to emphasize this - are the tremendous people working with me at our corporate office. Now, this isn't the kind of team that gets a lot of publicity, but they're absolutely essential. They handle an incredible workload - we're talking about a 30,450-page Federal tax return, 3,580 state tax returns, constant shareholder and media inquiries, putting together our annual report, organizing the country's largest annual meeting, coordinating board activities, and fact-checking my letters.
