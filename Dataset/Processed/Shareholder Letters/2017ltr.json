Here's why: Berkshire owns about $170 billion in marketable stocks, and in any given quarter, the value of these holdings can swing by $10 billion or more. Under this new rule, we have to include these paper gains or losses in our net income figures. Now, think about that for a minute. These swings are going to completely overwhelm the numbers that actually matter - our operating performance. It's like trying to hear someone whisper in a thunderstorm. The changes in our stock portfolio's value can be wild and capricious, and they have absolutely nothing to do with how our businesses are actually performing. I've always said that for analytical purposes, these figures will be useless. We don't sell securities to influence earnings - we sell when it makes business sense. These unrealized gains and losses are essentially random fluctuations, and including them in our reported net income will make our bottom-line figures meaningless for anyone trying to understand how Berkshire is really doing."

        "value": "Let me address this head-on because it's a crucial point for our shareholders to understand. We've always had challenges in our financial communications regarding gains - both realized and unrealized. The realized gains are those that accounting rules have long required us to include in our net income when we actually sell securities. The unrealized gains are the paper profits or losses on stocks we continue to hold, which now must be included in our reported income under the new GAAP rule. Here's the key thing: both types of gains fluctuate randomly and neither one tells you much about how our businesses are actually performing. We've consistently warned our shareholders in our quarterly and annual press releases not to focus on realized gains because they're essentially meaningless for analytical purposes. Why? Because we make our selling decisions based on what makes business sense, not to influence our earnings reports in any way. Now with this new rule adding unrealized gains to the mix, the distortion in our reported numbers will be even more dramatic. The fundamental principle here is that these gains - whether realized or unrealized - are not the right metrics to use when evaluating Berkshire's performance."

We've consistently warned our shareholders not to get too caught up in realized gains because, just like unrealized gains, they fluctuate randomly. You see, we make our selling decisions based on what makes business sense, not to manipulate earnings in any particular quarter. Sometimes we might show substantial realized gains during a period when our overall portfolio actually performed poorly, or vice versa. Now, with these new accounting rules regarding unrealized gains, the distortion becomes even more pronounced. That's why we're taking extra care every quarter to explain the adjustments you need to make sense of our numbers. What really matters at Berkshire - and I want to emphasize this - is the increase in our normalized per-share earning power. That's the number you should focus on. The quarterly fluctuations, whether from realized or unrealized gains, are essentially accounting noise that can mislead rather than inform."

We know that media commentary on earnings is often instantaneous, and newspaper headlines typically focus on year-over-year GAAP net income changes, which can unnecessarily frighten or encourage readers. By releasing our reports over the weekend, we're providing time for more thoughtful, informed commentary to develop. Additionally, we're committed to explaining the necessary adjustments in detail every quarter. I recognize that for many shareholders, accounting is like a foreign language, and we expect there will be considerable confusion. That's why we're putting in the extra effort to help our shareholders understand what really matters in these numbers.

Second, we seek bolt-on acquisitions that complement businesses we already own. Third, we focus on internal sales growth and margin improvement across our various operations. And fourth, we count on investment earnings from our substantial portfolio of stocks and bonds. Now, regarding 2017 specifically, I have to tell you that we faced some real challenges on the acquisition front. The market conditions were such that prices for decent - and I emphasize decent, not spectacular - businesses reached all-time highs. We saw an army of optimistic purchasers who seemed to treat price as almost irrelevant. This created a significant barrier for us because we insist on a sensible purchase price - it's one of our fundamental requirements, along with durable competitive strengths, high-grade management, good returns on net tangible assets, and opportunities for internal growth at attractive returns. We're not going to abandon these principles just because the market gets frothy. That's not how we operate at Berkshire."

It's pushing on an open door. Once that acquisition hunger sets in, you can bet your bottom dollar that CEOs will never run short of forecasts that justify whatever price they want to pay. This is why at Berkshire, we take a completely different approach. We focus on what really counts - increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That's what Charlie and I concentrate on, and that's what we want our shareholders to understand. We're not interested in playing the game of making acquisitions just to make them. When prices aren't sensible - as they weren't in 2017 - we're perfectly content to wait. Remember, price discipline isn't just one of many factors for us - it's absolutely fundamental to our acquisition strategy."

You see, once a CEO gets the acquisition bug, it's like a teenager with hormones - they just can't help themselves. The problem is they'll never lack for people telling them exactly what they want to hear. The investment bankers - who are like barbers always telling you that you need a haircut - will be there with their fancy spreadsheets showing wonderful projections. The subordinates will be cheerleading because they see bigger empires and bigger paychecks in their future. If the target company's actual performance doesn't justify the price, suddenly everyone starts talking about 'synergies.' And in recent years, with debt being so cheap, it's become even easier to make the numbers look good. You can usually boost per-share earnings if you pile on enough debt. But at Berkshire, we've always taken a different approach. We look at deals on an all-equity basis, we rarely count on synergies, and we're very careful about debt. It might mean we miss some deals, but we'd rather miss an opportunity than risk what we have."

Yes, our aversion to leverage has probably dampened our returns over the years - that's just mathematics. But we evaluate acquisitions on an all-equity basis because our taste for overall debt is very low. We don't play games by assigning large portions of debt to individual businesses - that would be fallacious in most cases. Now, there are some exceptions, like debt for Clayton's lending portfolio or our regulated utilities' fixed-asset commitments. But generally, we're very conservative here. And you know what? Charlie and I sleep well at night. We held this same view 50 years ago when we were running investment partnerships with money from friends and relatives who trusted us. That trust means something to us, and we're not going to risk it just to juice our returns. The fact that we can get slightly higher returns by leveraging up just isn't worth the risk to us."

And you know what? We haven't changed our minds even now that we have a million or so partners at Berkshire. It's really quite simple - the fundamental principle of protecting what's essential versus reaching for the unnecessary hasn't changed. In fact, we've found that this becomes even more important as others become less prudent. That's why we have another key guideline: The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.

Second, and this is crucial, it's been run by the remarkable Haslam family, starting with 'Big Jim' Haslam who built it from a single gas station 60 years ago. Now his son Jimmy manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughout North America. We love family-run businesses with proven track records. We structured the deal to start with a 38.6% partnership interest, with an agreement to increase to 80% in 2023. The Haslam family will retain 20%, which keeps that crucial family involvement we value. And here's a practical tip - when you're driving on the Interstate, stop in. They've got gasoline, diesel fuel, good food, and even 5,200 showers across their properties. That's the kind of practical, customer-focused business we like to own."

You see, when we write these insurance policies, that float is essentially locked in for the duration of the policy period. We can't face what I call a 'run on the bank' situation where everyone demands their money back at once. This characteristic became particularly valuable during the 2008-2009 crisis. During that period, we were very comfortable having Treasury Bills - lots of them - rather than depending on things like bank lines or commercial paper. I've always believed that you should never operate a business in a way that depends on the kindness of strangers, or even friends who might be facing their own liquidity problems. That's why we've intentionally built Berkshire to withstand economic discontinuities, even extreme scenarios like extended market closures. Now, I should point out that float isn't all upside - it comes with risk, sometimes oceans of risk. But the fact that it's stable and can't be withdrawn suddenly is a characteristic of prime importance to us, and we factor that heavily into our investment decisions."

By 2017, we had grown to $60,597 million in premium volume and $114,500 million in float, making us the country's second-largest p/c company by premium volume and the leader in float. Now, 2017 was actually an unusual year because we did this massive deal with AIG - we reinsured up to $20 billion of their long-tail losses for a premium of $10.2 billion. That was a world record, and I'll tell you right now, we won't come close to repeating that. Looking forward, we expect our premium volume to fall somewhat, and our float will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When we do eventually see a decline in float, it won't be dramatic - we're talking about 3% or so at most in any single year. This steady, measured growth reflects our conservative approach. We're not interested in growing just for growth's sake - we want sustainable, profitable growth that doesn't expose us to unnecessary risks."

Look at Lloyds of London - here's an operation that had a stellar track record for three centuries. But in the 1980s, they ran into huge problems with some long-tail insurance lines that nearly brought down the whole operation. That's why at Berkshire, we approach this very differently. Our insurance managers operate with a deeply conservative culture. We've always prioritized careful, disciplined underwriting. This approach has served us well, generating underwriting profits in most years, which effectively means we're being paid to hold float rather than paying to use it. But I should emphasize - and I've said this repeatedly - we've been fortunate with catastrophe experience in recent years. This isn't a permanent condition. Just look at last September when we had three major hurricanes hit Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. We estimate our losses from those events at about $3 billion pre-tax. The key is maintaining underwriting discipline regardless of market conditions. You can't get casual about risk in the insurance business - that's when you get into trouble."

Our current estimate for the industry-wide losses from those hurricanes I mentioned is around $100 billion, but I'll be the first to tell you that figure could be way off the mark. Here's what we've learned from experience: the initial loss estimates for major catastrophes typically run low. As V.J. Dowling - who's a very astute insurance analyst - points out, an insurer's loss reserves are similar to a self-graded exam. Think about that analogy for a moment. You've got three factors that can really distort the numbers: ignorance, wishful thinking, and sometimes even outright fraud. Any of these can mask an insurer's true financial condition for a very long time. That's why we at Berkshire are always cautious about initial loss estimates. We try to be realistic and even conservative in our assessments, but even then, the final numbers can surprise you. It's one of those areas in insurance where you need to maintain a healthy skepticism about the numbers you're seeing, especially in the early stages after a major event."

Now, that might sound like a lot, but it reduced our GAAP net worth by less than 1%. Compare that to other reinsurance companies that saw their net worth drop by 7% to over 15%. That tells you something about our financial strength. We're built to handle these hits. Looking at the bigger picture, we estimate we'll take about 3% of industry losses in future American mega-cats. But here's the key point - no company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-catastrophe. If such an event happened, we might take a $12 billion hit, but that's still well below what we expect to earn annually from our non-insurance activities. Meanwhile, most of the property-casualty insurance world would be wiped out. We've deliberately positioned ourselves to handle these extreme events, while others simply can't sustain those kinds of losses. That's not luck - it's careful planning and maintaining the financial strength to handle the worst-case scenarios."

Now, I'll be the first to tell you that no one knows the exact probability - we're dealing with estimates here. But what we do know with certainty is that this risk isn't static - it's actually increasing over time. And there's a very simple reason for that: we're seeing continuous growth in both the number and value of structures in catastrophe-vulnerable areas. Just look at what happened with the recent hurricanes. We had $100 billion in industry losses, and it could have been much worse. If Hurricane Irma had tracked just a bit further east through Florida, we might have been looking at an additional $100 billion in insured losses. That's why we have to be constantly vigilant and realistic about these risks. The key is to acknowledge the uncertainty while preparing for the worst. Some in our industry prefer to ignore these possibilities or engage in wishful thinking - and occasionally, we even see downright fraud in how these risks are reported. But at Berkshire, we believe in facing these realities head-on and maintaining the financial strength to handle them."

The key difference is that while such an event would put much of the p/c industry out of business, we'd keep right on ticking. That's why other insurers come to Berkshire - and only Berkshire - when they need huge reinsurance coverage for large future payments. You see, in insurance, there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages. What matters is having the financial strength to back up your commitments and the brain power to price risks correctly. We're fortunate to have extraordinary managers running our p/c operations who supply the brains, while Berkshire provides the capital.

I've regularly said that while I expect Berkshire to achieve underwriting profits in most years, we will absolutely experience losses from time to time. This isn't just theory - it became reality in 2017 when we took a $3.2 billion pre-tax loss from underwriting. This is simply the nature of the insurance business.

For decades, we've maintained in our Owner-Related Business Principles that we expect the undistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings through capital gains down the road. Now, these capital gains might come in lumpy fashion - especially with the new GAAP rules requiring us to record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. But I'm confident that the earnings retained by our investees will, over time and when viewed as a group, translate into matching capital gains for Berkshire. Think of it this way: we're not just counting the cash dividends that come in the door today; we're looking at the total earning power of these businesses, including what they reinvest for future growth.

The key thing to understand is that there's often a disconnect between short-term price movements and the actual building of value. Let me give you a concrete example from Berkshire's own history. For 53 years, we've consistently built value by reinvesting earnings and letting compound interest work its magic. Year after year, we've moved forward in terms of underlying value. Yet despite this steady progress, we've experienced four major price dips - I'm talking about declines ranging from 37% to 59%. This perfectly illustrates what Ben Graham meant when he said the market is a voting machine in the short run but a weighing machine in the long run. You see, stocks surge and swoon in ways that seem completely untethered from any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value. But over time, the connection between retained earnings and value becomes clear. The earnings retained by our investees will, when viewed as a group over time, translate into commensurate capital gains for Berkshire. You just can't see this connection in the short term - it's impossible to detect. But that doesn't mean it's not there."

Even more recently, during the financial crisis, we saw our stock drop from 147,000 to 72,400. Here's the crucial point: there is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if you think you're being conservative with your borrowing, even if your positions aren't immediately threatened by a plunging market, there's another factor at play - psychology. Your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. This is why I emphasize that even small borrowings can be dangerous when you're investing in stocks. The combination of financial and psychological pressure can be devastating when markets go through their inevitable periods of decline.

You see, even if you've only borrowed a modest amount and aren't facing immediate margin calls, your mind can become completely rattled by all those scary headlines and breathless commentary you see everywhere. And here's the key point - an unsettled mind will not make good decisions. That's why I always come back to Kipling's 'If' - it captures exactly what an investor needs: the ability to keep your head when others are losing theirs. The real problem is that the market doesn't give you warning signs. The light can switch from green to red without even pausing at yellow. That's why debt is so dangerous - it removes your ability to think clearly and act rationally exactly when you need those capabilities the most. The irony is that major declines actually offer extraordinary opportunities, but only to those who aren't handicapped by debt. You need both emotional stability and financial flexibility to take advantage of those moments."

Let me put this in perspective with what we saw in our bet. These funds-of-funds we were up against weren't just one layer of management - they were funds investing in other funds, which means multiple levels of fees. You had the main advisory firm, Protégé, which selected five investment experts, who then selected hundreds of other investment experts running hedge funds. Each layer takes its cut. Now, you might think with all this expertise - all these bright minds and sophisticated strategies - surely they must be adding value. But that's exactly what I wanted to challenge. The enormous importance I'm talking about is that millions of Americans are paying these fees year after year, thinking they're buying superior investment performance, when in fact they might be doing just the opposite.

These managers were taking around 2.5% in fixed fees every year, which is a staggering drag on performance. Think about it - even if they lost money for their investors, the managers could still get very rich from these fees. The fees were split between the fund-of-funds managers and the underlying hedge fund managers - we're talking about over 200 managers here. It's like paying a lot of very expensive chefs to cook a meal that doesn't taste as good as a simple home-cooked dinner.

But here's the real kicker - even if they lost money for their investors, they still collected that enormous 2.5% fixed fee on assets. It's like paying a chef not only for the meals they serve you but also giving them a bonus for every day the sun rises. The fee structure meant these managers could get very rich regardless of their actual performance. When you look at the scorecard, you can see the impact. These funds consistently underperformed the S&P, yet the managers were still collecting their fees. This is why I've always said that structure drives behavior. When managers can make substantial money regardless of performance, it doesn't create the right alignment with investor interests. The frosting, as I called it in this case, was actually bigger than the cake."

Here's the key point: these sophisticated funds with their layers of fees had every opportunity to succeed. The market conditions weren't unusual - if you'd asked experts in 2007, they would have predicted returns pretty close to what the S&P 500 actually delivered. The Wall Street 'helpers' made fortunes in fees during this period, but their investors experienced what I'd call a lost decade. As I always say: Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter. That's the lesson - consistent fees eat away at returns, and expensive professional management often can't overcome this handicap, even in perfectly normal market conditions."

This demonstrates the market's underlying rationality over longer periods, even though we might see periods of irrational behavior in shorter timeframes. The professional funds, with all their sophisticated strategies and attempts to outsmart these market movements, actually ended up underperforming significantly.

These bonds were set to give us a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity, which seemed reasonable at the time. But then something very strange happened in the bond market. By November 2012, with about five years left to maturity, these same bonds were selling for 95.7% of face value, which meant the yield had dropped to a pitiful 0.88%. Now, that's what I call a really dumb investment when compared to American equities. The S&P 500, which represents a broad cross-section of American business, has historically earned well over 10% annually on shareholders' equity. This situation perfectly illustrates why you can't just make an investment decision and put it on autopilot. You need to constantly compare opportunities and be willing to change course when the facts change.

At that time in late 2012, it was paying a dividend yield of about 2.5% - that's triple what our Treasury bonds were yielding. And here's the kicker: those dividends were almost certain to grow. But that's not all. The companies in the S&P 500 were retaining huge sums of earnings to either expand their operations or buy back their shares. Both of these actions tend to increase earnings-per-share over time. You see, it's really quite simple - American business has been a fantastic investment since 1776, and despite any temporary problems, the American economy has always moved forward.

When you look at a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities over a longer period, it becomes progressively less risky than bonds - with an important caveat. Those stocks need to be purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to the prevailing interest rates. Let me give you a concrete example from our bet with Protégé. In 2012, what many considered 'risk-free' long-term bonds were, in my view, actually far riskier than common stocks for long-term investment. Why? Because even a modest 1% annual inflation rate would erode the purchasing power of those bonds. Remember, real investment risk is about failing to meet your objective of greater future consumption. By that standard, bonds were the riskier choice for long-term investors, even though they appeared safer on the surface."

This definition has very practical implications for how we make investment decisions. Take our bet with Protégé as an example. When we switched from government bonds to Berkshire shares, we weren't worried about short-term market fluctuations. Our only real risk was that the end of 2017 might coincide with an exceptionally weak stock market. We considered this possibility - which always exists - to be very low for two specific reasons: first, Berkshire's reasonable price in late 2012, and second, the large asset build-up we were confident would occur at Berkshire during those five years. The bonds we sold, despite being considered 'risk-free' by many, actually carried more real risk for a long-term investor because they couldn't protect purchasing power even against modest inflation.

The key is understanding that a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds over longer periods, provided you're buying those stocks at sensible prices relative to prevailing interest rates. It's actually a terrible mistake for these long-term investors to measure their risk by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks. I've seen many institutional investors fall into this trap, thinking they're being conservative by loading up on high-grade bonds, when they're actually increasing their portfolio's risk.
