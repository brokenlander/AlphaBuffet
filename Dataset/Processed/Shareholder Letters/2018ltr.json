On the other hand, in years when the S&P 500 has a negative return, our after-tax numbers would actually look better because we wouldn't have to pay as much in taxes. Over time, though, those tax costs add up and cause us to trail the S&P 500 pretty substantially."

That last one's a bit of a wild card, if you ask me, and Charlie Munger agrees - we don't think it's sensible to include those mark-to-market changes in our earnings."
