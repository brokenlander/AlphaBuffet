Look at what happened: In 2018, our GAAP earnings were only $4 billion because the stock market went down and we had to report $20.6 billion in unrealized losses. Then in 2019, when the market went up, we showed $81.4 billion in earnings due to $53.7 billion in unrealized gains. That's a 1,900% increase in reported earnings! But here's the reality - in what I call the 'real world' versus 'accounting-land,' our equity holdings stayed pretty steady at around $200 billion during both years, and the intrinsic value of our stocks actually grew steadily and substantially. These quarterly and annual swings are really just paper gains and losses - they're capricious fluctuations that don't reflect the true state of our business. That's why Charlie and I strongly encourage investors to focus on operating earnings instead. The market will always have these gyrations, but they don't tell you much about how our businesses are actually performing."

Charlie and I continue to expect our equity holdings, as a group, to deliver major gains for Berkshire over time. Now, it's important to understand that these gains won't come in any predictable pattern - they'll be highly irregular and sometimes quite volatile, as we saw with those wild swings between 2018 and 2019. But that's the nature of equity investments. What matters isn't the quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year fluctuations, but the long-term appreciation in intrinsic value. That's why we maintain substantial equity positions despite the accounting noise they create in our reported earnings. The key is to look past the short-term market gyrations and focus on the fundamental value these investments create for Berkshire over the long haul."

He went into his research with one theory - that stocks and bonds would each have their time to shine depending on inflation or deflation. But what he found was something far more powerful. The real magic, as Keynes pointed out in reviewing Smith's work, was the compound interest effect created by retained earnings. You see, when good companies keep some of their profits and reinvest them in the business rather than paying everything out as dividends, they create this wonderful compounding machine. I've always said that compound interest is a force of nature, and Smith was one of the first to really document how this works in corporate America. What makes this insight so important is that it helps explain why well-managed companies can create such extraordinary value over time. They're essentially reinvesting on behalf of shareholders, building value year after year. It's why Charlie and I have always favored businesses that can reinvest their earnings at high rates of return. Smith's 'failure,' as he called it, ended up revealing one of the most powerful forces in long-term investing."

This is one of the most important things for investors to understand. The market will bounce around wildly in the short term - that's just its nature. But what really matters is the underlying power of retained earnings working in your favor over long periods. Think about what we learned from Smith's work - good companies retain and reinvest profits, creating a compounding effect that builds value over time. This fundamental economic reality is what gives us our optimism about equities, despite knowing there will be plenty of ups and downs along the way. The key is to focus on the long-term economics of the business rather than trying to predict market movements. When you own pieces of excellent businesses with good management and the power of retained earnings working in your favor, temporary market volatility becomes much less important. That's why we maintain our optimistic view about our equity holdings as a group, even while acknowledging the irregular nature of returns."

The key insight was that good businesses create additional value through compound interest when they retain and reinvest their earnings. Look at what Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Ford did - they built incredible wealth by keeping profits in their businesses to fund growth and generate even greater returns. The funny thing is, this wasn't some hidden secret. These titans of industry were doing it right in front of everyone's eyes. But here's what happened: when business ownership got divided into small pieces we call stocks, people completely missed this fundamental point. Instead of seeing stocks as ownership in businesses that could compound value through retained earnings, they viewed them merely as gambling tickets for short-term market movements. Even the best stocks were seen as speculations, while bonds were considered the gentlemanly investment. It's really quite remarkable that this misunderstanding persisted until Smith came along and spelled it out. Today, as I mentioned in the text, even schoolchildren understand what Keynes called 'novel' - that combining savings with compound interest works wonders."

But as our success grew, we faced an interesting challenge that not many businesses have to deal with: working with huge and ever-growing sums of money. You see, we follow the same principle that made those industrial titans - Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford - so successful. We understand what Keynes and Smith wrote about: that sound industrial investments can increase in real value at compound interest over time. But here's the catch - when you're dealing with the kind of money we manage at Berkshire, finding ways to reinvest those retained earnings effectively becomes increasingly challenging. It's one thing to reinvest a million dollars; it's quite another to efficiently deploy billions. That's why I say sometimes this job has been easy, but at other times, it's been more than difficult. The principle is simple, but the execution at our scale requires constant attention and discipline."

        "value": "Well, let me be very clear about this. At Berkshire, we have a straightforward hierarchy for deploying our retained earnings. Our absolute top priority - and this will never change - is reinvesting in the productive operational assets of businesses we already own. Just look at the numbers: in the past decade, while our depreciation was $65 billion, we actually invested $121 billion back into property, plant and equipment. That's real money going into real assets that produce real value. When we look beyond our existing operations, we're constantly searching for new businesses to buy, but they must meet three non-negotiable criteria. First, they need to earn good returns on their net tangible capital - we're not interested in businesses that require huge capital just to generate mediocre returns. Second, they must have able and honest managers - this is absolutely crucial and we won't compromise on it. Third, they have to be available at a sensible price - because paying too much for even a great business is a poor investment. We prefer to buy companies outright, but those opportunities are rare. More often, we find these qualities in publicly-traded companies where we can buy large but non-controlling positions. The stock market's fickleness often serves up these opportunities to us."

Whether we buy 100% of a company or take a major stake through the stock market, the fundamental driver of our financial results will be the future earnings of that business. That's the constant. However - and this is crucial - there's a huge accounting difference between these two approaches. When we buy a company outright, we're able to directly reinvest in that business and see those investments reflected properly in our financial statements. Take our existing operations - we've put $121 billion into property, plant and equipment over the last decade, far exceeding our depreciation charges of $65 billion. That shows up clearly in our books. With partial ownership through the stock market, while we're still participating in the underlying business earnings, the accounting treatment is quite different. The market often gives us these opportunities when it becomes fickle, which can be to our advantage, but you need to understand this key distinction in how these investments are treated in our financial statements. This isn't just an academic point - it's fundamental to understanding how we create value at Berkshire through these different investment approaches."

In our controlled companies - and by that I mean businesses where we own more than 50% - all of their earnings flow directly into Berkshire's operating earnings that we report to you. It's straightforward - what you see is what you get. But with our non-controlled companies, where we own marketable stocks, only the dividends we receive show up in our reported operating earnings. Now, here's what's important: those companies are still retaining earnings and creating value, often lots of value, but you won't see that value creation in Berkshire's reported earnings. Those retained earnings are working hard for us - they're being used to expand businesses, improve efficiency, or sometimes buy back stock which increases our ownership percentage. But due to accounting rules, this value creation doesn't show up directly in our reported numbers. This might not matter much to most companies, but for Berkshire, it's what I'd call a 'standout omission' because we have such large positions in these non-controlled companies. That's why we always make sure to lay out these details for our shareholders - you need to see the full picture, not just what GAAP accounting shows you."

        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "Let me explain how these retained earnings work for us, even though they're not visible in our reported numbers. Typically, our investee companies put these retained earnings to work in two main ways. First, they use them to expand their business operations and increase efficiency - this is just good business sense and helps grow the underlying value of our investment. Second, and this is important, they sometimes use those funds to repurchase their own stock. When they do this, it automatically increases Berkshire's share of the company's future earnings without us having to do anything. Both of these approaches create real value for Berkshire shareholders, even though you won't see it directly in our operating earnings under GAAP accounting. Now, we specifically list out our 10 largest stock-market holdings so you can see this difference - the gap between the dividends we receive (which show up in our earnings) and our share of their retained earnings (which don't). It's like having a successful business that's reinvesting in itself - you might not see the benefits in today's cash register, but the value is being created nonetheless. That's why we always encourage our shareholders to look beyond just the reported earnings to understand the full value being created in our portfolio."

But here's the reality I've learned: what happens after the honeymoon period often diverges quite a bit from those pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes you get lucky, and the union delivers results beyond what either party hoped for. But I have to be honest - in many cases, the buyer (that would be us at Berkshire) is the one who encounters the unpleasant surprises. It's just too easy to get dreamy-eyed during those corporate courtships. Looking back at our record, I'd say we're batting okay - most of our corporate marriages have worked out reasonably well, with both sides still happy with their long-ago decisions. Some have been absolutely idyllic. But I have to admit, there have been more than a few where I found myself wondering, sometimes quite quickly, what in the world I was thinking when I proposed. Tom Murphy gave me some of the best advice I've ever received about this: 'To achieve a reputation as a good manager, just be sure you buy good businesses.' Sounds simple, but it's proven remarkably accurate over the years."

Now, we have to accept that this path isn't always smooth - there will be periodic losses, and these can come in two flavors: sometimes they're specific to individual companies, and other times they're tied to broader stock market downturns. But here's the important part - we also see years like last year where our gains can be outsized. This variability is just part of the business. What really matters is the long-term trajectory. When we invest in businesses that retain and effectively reinvest their earnings, we're essentially partnering with them in their growth journey. Mr. Smith understood this principle perfectly. It's really about having the patience to let compound interest work its magic through these retained earnings, even when we face those inevitable periodic setbacks. That's why we focus so much on finding businesses that not only generate strong earnings but also have smart management teams who know how to reinvest those earnings effectively."

What happens is they gradually require less and less of Berkshire's capital as they shrink in relative importance. Now, on the flip side, our good businesses typically do just the opposite. They grow and find attractive opportunities to reinvest capital at good rates. Let me give you a perfect example of this pattern - our original textile business. When we took control of Berkshire in 1965, that struggling textile operation consumed almost all of our capital and was, frankly, a huge drag on our returns. But as we gradually acquired better businesses over the years, by the early 1980s that textile operation had become just a tiny portion of our overall capital deployment. Today, I'm happy to say we have most of your money working in controlled businesses that generate good to excellent returns on their tangible assets. It's like having two gardens - one with thriving plants that keep growing and producing fruit, and another with plants that gradually wither. Over time, the thriving garden naturally becomes more and more of your total garden."

What's interesting, and somewhat fortunate for us, is that even when I've made errors in selection, there's been a sort of natural limiting factor on the damage. The poor businesses tend to shrink in importance to Berkshire over time, while our winners grow and compound their advantage. Think about our insurance operations - that's been our superstar, with some unique characteristics that make it especially valuable to us. But the key lesson here is about initial selection. When you get it wrong - and I certainly have - you're going to spend time wondering what you were thinking. The saving grace is that these mistakes tend to become smaller problems over time through their own stagnation, while your good choices tend to grow in importance. It's critical to understand this dynamic, but even more critical to focus on making better initial choices. The best way to win this game isn't to count on poor businesses naturally shrinking away - it's to be right in your initial assessment and selection of businesses."

You see, in our P/C operations, we receive premium payments upfront, but we don't pay out claims until later - sometimes much later. That timing difference creates what we call float, which is essentially money that we're holding but will eventually belong to others. Now, here's the beautiful part - while we're holding that float, we get to invest it for our benefit. When I bought National Indemnity in 1967, we had just $39 million in float. By 2019, that number had grown to $129.4 billion. That's not a typo - billion with a B. What makes this especially valuable is that our float tends to be very stable relative to our premium volume. And by design, through the nature of our insurance contracts, we can never face immediate or near-term demands for significant portions of our cash resources. At most, our float might decline by 3% in any given year. This stability, combined with the ability to invest these funds, has been absolutely crucial to Berkshire's growth over the decades. It's been the engine driving our success since we first entered the insurance business."

What really makes this business model special is how we've designed it for unmatched financial strength. Take our acquisition of National Indemnity - we bought it for $8.6 million in 1967, and today it's the largest P/C company in the world by net worth. This didn't happen by accident. We specifically structure our insurance contracts so we're never exposed to immediate or significant cash demands. This conservative approach means our financial commitments are predictable and manageable. Even in extreme cases, like asbestos claims or severe workplace accidents where payments might stretch over decades, we're well-positioned to meet our obligations. The stability of our float, combined with our disciplined approach to underwriting and investing, creates a fortress-like financial position. That's why Berkshire's ability to honor its commitments is unmatched in the industry. It's a business model that's served us extraordinarily well for over 50 years."

That's a beautiful business model when it works. But here's the key thing that's changed: for most P/C insurers, the financial value of float isn't what it used to be. The reason is pretty straightforward. Most insurance companies invest heavily in high-grade bonds - and that's actually the proper strategy for them. But over the last decade, we've seen pathetically low interest rates. Where insurers could once safely earn 5 or 6 cents on each dollar of float, they're now getting maybe 2 or 3 cents, sometimes even less in countries with negative rates. As their old bond portfolios mature or get called by issuers, they're forced to reinvest at these lower yields. It's like having a great tool but finding out it doesn't work as well as it used to. Some insurers might be tempted to chase yield by buying lower-quality bonds or alternative investments, but that's a dangerous game that most aren't equipped to play."

By ensuring we can't face sudden, large cash demands, we maintain control over our capital and investment decisions. This gives us enormous flexibility in how we manage our float and invest our assets. The nature of these contracts creates a foundation of stability that's essential to our long-term success. Remember, in insurance, financial strength isn't just about having money - it's about having the right structure to ensure you can always meet your obligations while maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities.

Now, I need to be completely straight with you - this doesn't mean we've found some magic formula for permanent success. We will most certainly not repeat this exact performance in the next 17 years. Insurance is a business where danger always lurks, and mistakes in assessing risks can be huge. Sometimes these mistakes don't show up for years or even decades.

If I asked you to close your eyes and imagine where a dynamic P/C insurer might come from, you'd probably think New York, London, or maybe Silicon Valley. But look at GUARD Insurance in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. When Ajit Jain - who's invaluable to our insurance operations - called me in 2012 about buying this tiny company for $221 million, I'd never even heard of GUARD or its CEO, Sy Foguel. But Ajit saw something special there, and boy, was he right. By 2019, GUARD's premium volume grew 379% to $1.9 billion, while delivering satisfactory underwriting profits. Sy has expanded into new products, new regions, and increased float by 265%. It reminds me of our own story - back in 1967, Omaha seemed an unlikely launching pad for a P/C giant too. The lesson here is that excellence in insurance doesn't depend on fancy addresses or flashy locations. It comes down to having the right people, like Sy and Ajit, who understand risk and can grow intelligently while maintaining underwriting discipline. That's what we look for at Berkshire."

These aren't market wagers to us - they're ownership stakes in companies that are earning more than 20% on their net tangible equity capital without excessive debt. That's remarkable. When you find businesses performing at that level, you don't let go of them just because some analyst downgrades them or because someone's worried about what the Fed might do next month. We're partial owners of these businesses, and we act like it. The Street often gets caught up in short-term thinking and what I call the 'subject du jour' - whatever everyone's worried about this week. That's not investing; that's speculating.

Those pundits are telling you more about themselves than about the future. But here's what we can say with some confidence: Look at our companies earning over 20% on their net tangible equity. Now compare that to what many investors have been accepting on bonds - 2½% or even less on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds. That contrast is, as I say in my letter, truly mind-blowing. And if we look forward, assuming corporate tax rates stay near current levels and interest rates remain anywhere close to where they are, it's almost certain that equities will outperform long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments over time. That's not a forecast - it's just mathematics. The earning power of solid businesses held for the long term will, in my view, invariably prove superior to fixed-dollar investments at today's rates."

Now, I need to give you a clear warning here - this isn't a smooth ride. Stock prices can do anything in the short term. We will absolutely see major market drops, maybe 50% or even more at times. But for the individual investor who avoids borrowed money and can control their emotions, equities are still the better long-term choice. This is thanks to two powerful forces: what I call The American Tailwind and the wonderful effects of compounding that Mr. Smith described.

This diversification and the quality of our businesses form a rock-solid foundation. We've built this company to last, not just to look good in quarterly reports.

Fourth, we have exceptional managers who see Berkshire as more than just a prestigious job. They're in it for the long haul, just like Charlie and I are. Finally, our board of directors - your guardians, as I like to call them - are deeply committed to both shareholder interests and maintaining our unique corporate culture.

The foundations will be putting these resources to work in society while maintaining an orderly transition of the holdings.

It's particularly interesting to note this in the context of history - this year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in America. But while women gained access to the voting booth a century ago, their progress in reaching the boardroom has been much slower. It's still what I'd call a work in progress. Now, we've seen many new rules and guidelines come into place regarding board composition, and that's helping to drive change. But I think it's important to recognize how far we've come while acknowledging we still have a way to go.

Now, regarding oversight mechanisms, let's talk about audit committees as an example. Yes, they're working harder than ever before, and I'll give them credit for taking their responsibilities seriously. However - and this is important - these committees still struggle to catch managers who are determined to game the numbers. This problem has been made worse by two things: the scourge of earnings 'guidance' and CEOs' obsession with 'hitting the number.' You see, even with all our modern governance structures and increased scrutiny, we haven't fully solved these fundamental challenges. The basic truth is that good governance starts with getting the right CEO in place - someone with both talent and integrity.

And I have to be honest - I'm guilty of this myself. The process has become quite sophisticated, with lots of legal orchestration and expanding costs, but the basic problem remains. When a CEO wants a deal, they have their entire staff working to support that position. They control the information flow, the timing, and the presentation to the board. I've seen this pattern repeat itself across many companies - just look at the list of companies I've been involved with over the years, from Blue Chip Stamps to Kraft Heinz. The key issue isn't usually financial gain - what I've found particularly interesting is that when CEOs play with numbers or push for certain deals, it's more often driven by ego than by desire for monetary reward.

As for compensation committees, I've noticed a troubling trend. They've become increasingly dependent on consultants, which has led to more complicated compensation arrangements - after all, what committee member wants to justify paying big consulting fees year after year for a simple plan? The result? Proxy materials have become mind-numbing to read through. Now, I will say there has been one very important positive change: the requirement for regular executive sessions where directors meet without the CEO present. Before this was mandated, it was rare to have truly frank discussions about a CEO's performance, acquisition decisions, or compensation. But even with these improvements, the fundamental challenges remain. The system still struggles to effectively counter a determined CEO who wants to push through their agenda."

I've seen this play out across many companies - and yes, I'll include myself among the guilty. Here's an interesting thought experiment I've considered: What if companies hired two expert advisors - one to argue for the deal and one against it - with the winning advisor getting ten times what the loser gets?

Here's the process: When a non-wealthy director wants to join another board, their current CEO becomes a crucial reference. The prospective CEO will check with that current CEO about whether the director is 'good.' Now, 'good' is really a code word here. If that director has been challenging the CEO's compensation or questioning their acquisition plans, their chances of getting that second board seat will quietly disappear. The system is self-perpetuating because these positions are so attractive - you get excellent job security, generous age limits usually at 70 or higher, and very few directors ever get fired. They might get politely ignored, but they rarely get shown the door.

I was looking at a proxy statement from a large American company - a chronic underperformer, mind you - where eight directors had never bought a single share with their own money. Not one share! Sure, they had plenty of stock grants on top of their cash compensation, but they'd never reached into their own pockets. Now, I'm not saying that paying for shares automatically makes someone a business genius. But I'll tell you this - I feel a lot more comfortable when directors in our portfolio companies have had the experience of putting their own capital at risk, rather than just receiving grants. It's about having that owner's mentality. When your own money is on the line, you tend to think differently about the decisions you're making.

That's why we don't feel any urgency to buy even when we see what appears to be a bargain - say, buying an estimated dollar of value for 95 cents. We're very disciplined about this. For example, in 2019, we saw some modestly favorable opportunities and spent $5 billion repurchasing about 1% of the company. But we only did this when the price/value equation made sense to us. We're not interested in buybacks just for the sake of buybacks. It has to be the right price at the right time, and we have to maintain our strong financial position. That's non-negotiable."

We're looking for situations where we can buy a dollar of value for less than a dollar - but we're never in a rush to do so unless the price is clearly right. In 2019, for instance, we found some modest opportunities and spent about $5 billion buying back roughly 1% of the company. But here's the key thing to understand: we won't prop up the stock at any particular level. What we will do is become more aggressive in our purchasing when the price-to-value discount widens. Over time, we want Berkshire's share count to go down, but only when it makes good financial sense. Think of it this way - we're happy to buy when we see that estimated dollar of value selling for 95 cents, but we're not going to chase the price higher just to make repurchases. It's really about being patient and disciplined, waiting for the right opportunities when the price-to-value equation is in our favor."

        "value": "This is actually a fascinating story of transformation. When Berkshire entered its current form 55 years ago, we paid absolutely nothing in federal income tax - and for good reason. The company had been struggling so much in the previous decade that it had recorded a net loss. Now, fast forward to 2019, and we sent $3.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury for our current income tax, representing about 1.5% of all corporate income tax collected by the federal government that year. That's quite a journey from paying zero to becoming one of the country's largest corporate taxpayers. What's particularly interesting is how this transformation happened. By retaining nearly all of our earnings over the years, we've created value not just for our shareholders, but also for the federal government. The growth in our tax payments reflects the fundamental growth in our business operations. And looking ahead, we both hope and expect to send even larger sums to the Treasury in most future years. It's really a testament to how retaining and reinvesting earnings can build substantial value over time, benefiting both private shareholders and the public treasury."
