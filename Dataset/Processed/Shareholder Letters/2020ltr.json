You see, when our investee companies retain earnings instead of paying them out as dividends, those earnings don't show up in Berkshire's GAAP income - they become invisible on our books. But here's the important thing: those retained earnings are usually building tremendous value for Berkshire. The companies we invest in use these withheld funds to expand their businesses, make acquisitions, pay off debt, and often repurchase their stock. When they buy back shares, that actually increases our share of their future earnings. This isn't a new concept - it's the same principle that worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller, and it's worked its magic for millions of shareholders throughout American business history. Think about it this way: while we only record the dividends these companies pay us, our share of their retained earnings is continuously working to build long-term prosperity that we participate in proportionately. That's why Charlie and I view our marketable stock holdings - which were worth $281 billion at yearend - as a collection of businesses, not just pieces of paper."

        "value": "Let me be clear about this - the GAAP components related to capital gains or losses, whether realized or unrealized, can swing wildly from year to year simply because of stock market movements. These fluctuations are really just capricious in nature. But Charlie and I firmly believe that over time - and this is important - Berkshire's capital gains from its investment holdings will be substantial. Last year, for example, our operating earnings fell 9% and we didn't make any sizable acquisitions. However, we still managed to increase Berkshire's per-share intrinsic value through two methods: retaining earnings and repurchasing about 5% of our shares. What really matters is the long-term prosperity of the businesses we own shares in. While we don't control the operations of these companies, we do share proportionately in their long-term success. That's why we focus on the fundamental performance and potential of our investments rather than getting too caught up in how GAAP accounting presents the short-term picture. The market will fluctuate - that's just what markets do - but the underlying value creation through retained earnings and business growth is what drives long-term results."

Look at Carnegie and Rockefeller - they showed us the blueprint, and it's worked its magic for millions of shareholders since then. Now, I should be clear that not every company gets this right. Some businesses will retain earnings and create very little value - they're essentially just hoarding cash. But others will deliver spectacular results with those retained earnings. At Berkshire, we look at our share of retained earnings from our non-controlled businesses - what you might call our equity portfolio - as a sort of stored energy that should eventually create equal or greater capital gains. I'm pleased to say that over our 56-year history, this expectation has been met. It's really quite simple: when great businesses keep and reinvest their earnings wisely, shareholders ultimately benefit. The key is having the patience to let this compounding work its magic over time."

I was simply too optimistic about PCC's normalized profit potential. What happened here is instructive: even when you buy the best company in its business - which PCC certainly is - and even when you have excellent management - which we do in Mark Donegan - you can still make a significant mistake by misjudging future earnings potential. The aerospace industry's adverse developments last year exposed my miscalculation. I believe I was correct in my assessment that PCC would earn good returns on its net tangible assets over time. Where I went wrong was in my estimation of the average amount of future earnings, which led to paying too high a price. This resulted in that $11 billion write-down we had to take. The lesson here is that even with a great business and great management, the price you pay matters enormously. Being too optimistic in your assumptions about future earnings can lead to expensive mistakes, even for experienced investors."

First, and this is really unavoidable - the best businesses, the ones with real competitive advantages, simply weren't interested in being acquired. Think about it - if you've got a truly great business, why would you want to sell it? This meant conglomerates were fishing in what I'd call a mediocre pond, looking at second-tier companies that lacked important and durable competitive strengths. The second problem was the premium issue. When conglomerates did find businesses to buy, they often had to pay huge 'control' premiums to close the deal. Now, the conglomerators thought they were clever - they tried to solve this by creating their own overvalued stock to use as acquisition currency. It's like that old joke: 'I'll pay you $10,000 for your dog by giving you two of my $5,000 cats.' What's worse, many resorted to promotional tricks and creative accounting - sometimes even crossing into outright fraud - to keep their stock prices artificially high. These weren't sustainable strategies, and the results proved it."

The core error wasn't in my assessment that PCC would earn good returns on its net tangible assets over time - I still believe that analysis was correct. Where I went wrong was in my calculation of future earnings and, consequently, in determining the right price to pay for the business. This isn't my first error of this type, but it's certainly a significant one. I think it's crucial to be transparent about these mistakes. You see, in investing, being right about a company's quality isn't enough if you're wrong about the price you should pay. It's like having the right destination but taking the wrong road to get there. The key is to acknowledge these errors clearly and learn from them. I've always believed that the best investment lessons often come from studying our mistakes rather than our successes. With PCC, the lesson reinforces the importance of not just evaluating a business's quality, but also being extremely careful about our assumptions regarding future earnings and appropriate purchase price."

These companies would use promotional techniques and what I'll charitably call 'imaginative' accounting maneuvers that were often deceptive and sometimes crossed into outright fraud. The trick was to get their own stock valued at, say, 3 times its real business value, then use that inflated stock to offer 2 times value for their acquisition targets. Now, why did this continue? Well, you've got Wall Street loving those deal-making fees, and the press loving those colorful promoter stories. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where the rising stock price itself becomes the supposed 'proof' that the illusion is reality. But remember, eventually the party ends. Financial history is full of these supposed business geniuses who were celebrated by journalists and investment bankers, only to see their creations end up as business junkyards.

What Charlie and I came to understand is that what really matters isn't whether we control a business - what matters is owning pieces of truly wonderful businesses with good economic characteristics and good managers. I'll be completely frank - it took both Charlie's wisdom and my own 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited at Berkshire to finally get this through my head. What we learned is that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable, more enjoyable, and far less work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise. It's really that simple. We want our conglomerate to own all or part of a diverse group of excellent businesses, but whether Berkshire controls these businesses is actually unimportant to us. This is very different from the old conglomerate model where control was everything. We're much more interested in the quality of the business and its management than in having total control."

It's more profitable, more enjoyable, and frankly, it's a lot less work. You see, in business, unlike diving competitions, you don't get extra points for degree of difficulty. As Ronald Reagan wisely put it - 'It's said that hard work never killed anyone, but I say why take the chance?' This understanding fundamentally shapes how we run Berkshire today. We maintain a collection of both controlled and non-controlled businesses, and Charlie and I simply deploy capital wherever we see the best combination of three key factors: durable competitive advantages, strong management capability and character, and the right price. If we can achieve great returns with minimal effort through partial ownership of wonderful businesses, that's perfectly fine with us.

But here's the key thing - most of Berkshire's value actually comes from just four jewels. The crown jewel, if you will, is our property/casualty insurance operation, which has been the core of Berkshire for 53 years. Three of these key businesses we control outright, and in one we only have a 5.4% interest. This structure reflects our philosophy of flexibility - we're not wedded to any particular ownership structure. Whether we own 100% or just a small slice, what matters is the quality of the business and the value we get for our shareholders. We detail our subsidiaries on page A-1 of our annual report, and our major partial ownership positions are listed on page 7. This mix of controlled and non-controlled businesses gives us tremendous flexibility to allocate capital wherever we see the best opportunities, regardless of whether we can obtain full control or just a portion of a wonderful business."

But the real secret sauce is that we have this enormous cash flow coming in from our non-insurance businesses. You see, when you combine that financial strength with our reliable cash flows, we can do things other insurers simply can't do. Most insurance companies are forced by regulations and credit-rating requirements to focus heavily on bonds. They're stuck in that box, if you will. But look at bonds today - they're just not the place to be. When you've got 10-year Treasuries yielding less than 1% - down 94% from the 15.8% in 1981 - and some countries like Germany and Japan actually having negative yields, well, that's a terrible place to be trapped. We have the luxury of flexibility that others don't have. With our $138 billion of insurance float - money that isn't ours but that we can deploy - we can make different choices. But let me be clear: this isn't about taking foolish risks. Some insurers might try to juice their returns by chasing risky loans. That's not the answer - just ask the savings and loan industry that destroyed itself three decades ago doing exactly that."

First off, we have something no one else has - Ajit Jain, who joined us in 1986. He's built something truly unique in the insurance field. But what really sets us apart is how we've structured the financial side. We've built what I call our insurance fleet with more capital than any competitor worldwide. This gives us enormous flexibility in how we operate. Now, here's where it gets interesting - we've got this tremendous amount of float, $138 billion to be precise. That's money that technically doesn't belong to us, but we get to invest it. Think of it as other people's money that we can deploy in bonds, stocks, or cash equivalents like Treasury bills. This has been absolutely crucial to our success because it gives us investment opportunities that other insurers simply can't access. And remember, we've maintained this position as the largest in our field while staying conservative in our approach. We haven't gotten here by taking foolish risks or trying to juice returns with risky investments. It's been about building a sustainable, unique operation that can weather any storm while taking advantage of opportunities others can't."

Mary See understood this a century ago when she started with just a small outlet in Los Angeles. She didn't just sell candy - she reinvented it with special recipes and created an experience with quaint stores and friendly salespeople. That's why the business grew to hundreds of shops across the West. At Berkshire, we've learned that our job with See's is simply not to meddle with their success. The customers have given us a very clear message over these 100 years: 'Don't mess with my candy.' And we listen. This is why See's continues to delight customers while providing life-long employment for thousands. It's a perfect example of how success comes from focusing on the customer's experience and staying true to what works.

Look at Leo Goodwin and his wife Lillian - they started in 1936 with just $100,000 and went up against insurance companies that had 1,000 times more capital than they did. But they had something more valuable than money - they had an insight. They recognized that auto insurance, which was a standardized product typically sold through agents, could be sold directly to customers at a much lower price. This was revolutionary thinking at the time. The key here is that they identified an inefficiency in an existing market and found a way to benefit the customer through a better business model. They didn't need to create a new product - they just needed to deliver an existing one in a more efficient way. This shows that success in America often comes from having an idea and the ambition to execute it, even with just a pittance of capital. It's a story we've seen repeated throughout our country's history - individuals who see a better way to serve customers can succeed beyond their dreams, even when going up against entrenched competitors."

We've had some severe interruptions, and our progress toward becoming 'a more perfect union' has often been slow and uneven. Sometimes it's even been discouraging. But here's the key thing: we keep moving forward. That's why I maintain an unwavering conclusion: never bet against America. The evidence is all around us - just fly over cities like Knoxville or Omaha, and you'll see the results of this unique American experiment.

I didn't take a salary or management fees. Instead, I structured it so I only got compensated after my partners earned above a 6% annual threshold. If we didn't hit that mark, any shortfall would carry forward against my future profits. This was my way of ensuring that I ate my own cooking, as we say in Nebraska.

As for who invested with us, it was largely family and friends - my parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws made up a big portion of the partnership. Charlie operated similarly when he started his partnership in 1962. We didn't have any institutional investors, and most of our partners weren't particularly sophisticated in financial matters.

On one side, we have the active traders - both institutional and individual - who view their Berkshire shares as trading vehicles. These folks are constantly evaluating where to put their money, and they'll move it when they see better opportunities. That's perfectly fine - it's an honorable occupation, though a difficult one. We're happy to have them as owners while they search for what they consider better alternatives. Some of these professional managers are long-term focused, while others might trade in nanoseconds using computer algorithms. Then there's what I consider our core group - the million-plus individual investors who've joined us with no intent to leave. These folks simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future may bring. Charlie and I feel a special kinship with this group because they approach ownership the same way our original partners did. They're not looking at Berkshire as a trading vehicle - they're looking at it as a long-term partnership. It's similar to having a family business where some relatives might want to sell their shares while others are committed to holding forever. Both approaches are valid, but I'll admit we have a special appreciation for those long-term partners."

        "value": "Let me be clear about this - professional money management is an honorable occupation, but it's also a very challenging one. These managers have a specific mandate: they need to move their clients' money - whether it belongs to wealthy individuals, universities, or pensioners - from one investment to another based on their judgment of valuation and prospects. Now, what's interesting is how differently these professionals operate. Some of them take a long-term approach and rarely trade, which is closer to our own philosophy at Berkshire. Others are at the opposite end of the spectrum, using complex computer algorithms to make trading decisions in nano-seconds. And then you have those who move in and out of positions based on their macro-economic judgments. We work happily with all these active managers while they search for what they consider better places to deploy their clients' funds. It's important to understand that their job requires them to be active - that's what their clients are paying them for. This is quite different from index funds, which operate on automatic pilot and only trade for weighting purposes. The key thing to remember is that while we appreciate all our shareholders, we recognize that different types of investors have different objectives and time horizons, and that's perfectly fine with us."

He's a wonderful Omaha ophthalmologist who, along with 10 other doctors, formed Emdee Ltd. with me back in 1959. When we distributed Berkshire shares in 1969, all of these doctors kept their stock. They might not have known all the complexities of investing or accounting, but they knew one crucial thing: at Berkshire, they would be treated as partners. That's why we're not particularly interested in courting Wall Street analysts or institutional investors. We already have exactly the kind of shareholders we want. These are people who understand our philosophy and trust our approach. I don't believe we'd upgrade our shareholder base by replacing them with institutional investors. It's that simple."

Charlie and I are 97 and 90 ourselves, which led us to joke whether Berkshire ownership might actually foster longevity! But behind that humor is a serious point about our approach to partnerships. These doctors exemplify what we value most - they may not have been investment experts, but they understood partnership. When they received their Berkshire shares in 1969, they held onto them. That's over 50 years of trust and partnership. Many of our original investors and their descendants remain substantial owners of Berkshire today. This isn't just about holding stocks - it's about maintaining relationships built on trust and mutual respect over decades. When we talk about treating shareholders as partners, we're not just using corporate speak - we're describing real, enduring relationships like the ones with Stan and his colleagues."

We view our shareholders as partners in the business, as family really, and we want them to stick around for the long term. When you find good partners who understand your approach and values, why would you want to replace them? That's why we don't spend time courting Wall Street analysts or institutional investors. We don't believe they would be an upgrade to our current shareholder base. In fact, they might push us in directions that aren't consistent with our long-term philosophy.

We've been consistently serving hamburgers and Coke at Berkshire for 56 years, and we're not about to change our menu. The consistency of our message and approach has attracted exactly the type of clientele - or shareholders - we want. Look, there are plenty of other restaurants in the investment world. If investors want price targets, managed earnings, and exciting 'stories,' there are countless CEOs and market gurus ready to serve that up. If they're looking for technical analysis and chart reading, there are plenty of 'technicians' who'll tell them what every wiggle means. But that's not what we do at Berkshire. We stick to our simple, straightforward approach, and we're completely transparent about it. Our shareholders know exactly what they're getting when they invest with us, just like Fisher's restaurant customers know what to expect when they walk in the door."

You see, a patient and level-headed monkey throwing 50 darts at the S&P 500 board will do quite well over time - collecting dividends and capital gains - as long as it doesn't get tempted to make changes to its original picks. That's because ownership of stocks is fundamentally a positive-sum game. The key is having that inner calm and minimizing transactions and fees. You know, productive assets - farms, real estate, businesses - they naturally produce wealth over time. That's just how it works. But here's the important part: investors must never forget that their expenses are Wall Street's income. Those Wall Street folks, unlike my monkey, aren't working for peanuts. They'll always be there with their price targets, managed earnings, and 'stories.' They'll have technicians confidently telling you what some wiggles on a chart mean. But the reality is, success in investing doesn't require all that activity. It requires patience, diversification, and keeping costs low.

Look at BNSF and BHE, for example. We're absolutely delighted with these two giants. They went from earning $4.2 billion in 2011 to $8.3 billion in 2020, which was a tough year for many businesses.

Take BNSF for example - this railroad carries about 15% of all non-local ton-miles of goods moved in the United States, whether by rail, truck, pipeline, barge or aircraft. That's a fundamental part of America's business infrastructure. When you have assets that are this essential to the country's economy and they're generating growing earnings - like the increase from $4.2 billion to $8.3 billion we saw between 2011 and 2020 - you've got something special.

That's quite different from the old coal-based system where generation happened close to population centers. When we looked at this in 2006, it was clear somebody needed to build massive transmission infrastructure to bridge this gap. But here's why others wouldn't touch it: First, you had to invest billions upfront before seeing any meaningful revenue. Second, you were dealing with a regulatory maze - crossing multiple state borders, each with their own rules and constituencies. You had to negotiate with hundreds of landowners, coordinate with power generators on one end and utilities on the other. And let's not forget the competing interests - you had the old guard wanting to maintain the status quo, and then some folks on the other extreme wanting to transform everything overnight. It took an organization with deep pockets, management expertise, and most importantly, faith in America's political, economic and judicial systems to take this on.

Second, we have the managerial talent - people who understand how to navigate complex regulatory environments, handle multiple stakeholders, and execute complicated contracts with both suppliers and customers. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we have the institutional commitment to see things through. When we make promises, we keep them. We knew going into the western transmission project that there would be surprises and delays - that's just the nature of infrastructure development at this scale. But we also knew we had the staying power to handle whatever came our way. That's why even though this project will take many years to complete, we're actively looking for similar opportunities.
