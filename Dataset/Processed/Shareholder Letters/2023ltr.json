You see, I had made what he considered a dumb decision buying control of Berkshire, which was basically a struggling textile business at the time. But instead of just criticizing, he gave me a roadmap to fix it. He told me, 'Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. Add wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices.' This was revolutionary because it meant abandoning what I'd learned from Ben Graham, my mentor. Graham's approach worked, but as Charlie pointed out, only at a small scale. What's particularly remarkable about this advice is that Charlie had no personal stake in Berkshire at the time - not a dime invested. He was giving me this guidance purely as a friend and mentor. I'll admit I did some back-sliding, but Charlie kept jerking me back to sanity whenever my old habits surfaced. This fundamental shift in strategy - focusing on excellent businesses at reasonable prices rather than mediocre businesses at bargain prices - became the cornerstone of Berkshire's success."

        "value": "Looking at my relationship with Charlie, which began in 1959 and lasted until his death just shy of his 100th birthday, it's a testament to the power of intellectual honesty and mutual respect in a business partnership. Charlie wasn't afraid to tell me when I was wrong - like when he bluntly told me I'd made a dumb decision buying Berkshire. But he didn't just criticize; he provided solutions. What's particularly instructive is that our partnership began with pure intellectual collaboration - Charlie had no financial stake in our early ventures, yet he gave me crucial advice that would transform Berkshire. Many years later, when he became my formal partner in running Berkshire, we built something that exceeded both our expectations. Together, we and our early investors ended up far better off than either of us had ever dreamed possible. The key was that Charlie consistently served as my intellectual sounding board and voice of reason, pulling me back to sanity when I needed it. That's the real value of a great business partnership - someone who will tell you the truth, help correct your course, and stick with you through the long term."

Charlie was truly the architect of what Berkshire has become, while I served as the general contractor carrying out the day-to-day construction of his vision. You see, in the physical world, great buildings are remembered by their architects, while those who poured the concrete or installed the windows fade from memory. That's a perfect parallel to our situation at Berkshire. Charlie had this remarkable ability to see the big picture and design the blueprint of what we could become. He would jerk me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced, and together we built something far better than either of us had dreamed possible. What's particularly noteworthy about Charlie is that he never sought credit for his role as creator. He let me take the bows and receive the accolades, acting as part older brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I made mistakes - which I certainly did - he never reminded me of them. That's the kind of partner he was."

Charlie would expect me to maintain this regular communication with you, even now. It's not just about providing information - it's about being useful to our owners.

At Berkshire, we specifically seek shareholders who view their investment like buying a farm or rental property - people who plan to hold for the long term. We call them 'lifetime' shareholders. These aren't folks looking for hot tips or quick trades. They're investing their savings with us for the long haul, and we cherish that trust. That's why I won't delegate this communication to an investor-relations officer or some consultant who's going to serve up what I call 'optimism and syrupy mush.' Our shareholders deserve better than that. They deserve to hear directly from me, just as they would expect to hear directly from someone managing their family farm.

They're not looking to trade in and out; they're true long-term owners. And despite our occasional disagreements, we've never had anything close to a ruptured relationship. That's crucial because it shows the kind of stable, thoughtful partnership we seek with our shareholders. Every year, I know Bertie will read what I write, and I know she'll have questions that deserve honest answers. That's why I use her as my mental model when I'm writing to shareholders.

First, she instinctively knows that pundits should be ignored. Think about it - if someone could truly predict tomorrow's winners, would they share that information freely? That would be like finding gold and then handing your neighbors a map to its location. It just doesn't make sense. But more importantly, Bertie understands the power of incentives and human behavior. She's developed the ability to recognize the 'tells' in human behavior and can distinguish between who's simply selling something and who can be trusted. She reads her newspapers - four of them daily - but doesn't pretend to be an economic expert. She has enough knowledge to be informed but enough humility to know what she doesn't know. That's exactly the kind of balanced, clear-eyed approach that makes for successful long-term investing. She's nobody's fool, and that's exactly the mindset you need in the market."

Now, you might ask yourself, what in the world is going on here? These figures come with quite a pedigree - they're calculated according to FASB procedures, mandated by the SEC, and audited by Deloitte & Touche. But here's the thing - just because these numbers are official and carefully audited doesn't necessarily mean they tell the whole story of business performance. You'll find these numbers on page K-72, and yes, they represent the 'bottom line' that many owners and financial reporters focus on. But I've always believed that we need to look beyond just what the accounting rules require to understand the true economics of a business. These dramatic swings in reported earnings might satisfy accounting requirements, but they don't always reflect the underlying economic reality of our businesses. That's why I spend so much time in my annual letters trying to explain our results in a way that Bertie - and investors like her - can truly understand what's really happening in our businesses."

You see, we've got this situation where FASB, the SEC, and big accounting firms like Deloitte & Touche all sign off on these numbers with great ceremony. They put their stamp of approval on it, and legally, everyone's done their job. But here's the problem - these figures include unrealized capital gains and losses that can swing by more than $5 billion in a single day. That's not a sensible way to evaluate a business. At Berkshire, we prefer what we call 'operating earnings.' Look at our numbers: $27.6 billion in 2021, $30.9 billion in 2022, and $37.4 billion in 2023. These figures exclude those wild swings from unrealized gains and losses. Interestingly, this was pretty much the standard approach until 2018, when this 'improvement' was mandated. As I like to say, referring to Galileo's experience centuries ago, we shouldn't mess with mandates from on high when they don't make practical sense."

But here's the key point: it should only be a starting point in that evaluation. That's why we report our operating earnings alongside the mandated figures. You see, what troubles me is how these mandated numbers get sanctified by various authorities - FASB, SEC, prestigious accounting firms - and then get transmitted instantly worldwide through the internet and media. Everyone involved feels they've fulfilled their duty, and legally, they have. But at Berkshire, we're left uncomfortable with this approach. We believe in providing numbers that actually help investors understand the business. That's why we present our operating earnings, which tell a more coherent story about our business performance. It's about making earnings figures practical and meaningful, not just technically compliant with regulations that, frankly, might not serve the best interests of investors trying to make informed decisions."

You see, it's really quite foolish to make judgments about investment value based on the capricious day-by-day or even year-by-year movements of the stock market. What we're looking for at Berkshire is simple - we want to own businesses, either wholly or in part, that have good economics that are fundamental and enduring. I've been investing in U.S. equities since March 11, 1942, when I made my first stock purchase, and I've consistently kept the majority of my net worth in American equities since then. The Dow was below 100 when I started - I actually lost about $5 by the time school let out that year - but now it's around 38,000. The lesson here is clear: America has been a terrific country for investors. The secret isn't complicated - all they've needed to do is sit quietly and listen to no one. That's why we commit huge amounts of capital to marketable equities, both Berkshire's money and my own personal funds."

Since my first stock purchase on March 11, 1942, I've consistently maintained the majority of my net worth in U.S.-based equities. And you know what? So far, so good. Think about this: when I made that first purchase, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was below 100. Today, it's hovering around 38,000. That's the power of staying invested in American businesses. At Berkshire, we put our money where our mouth is - we commit huge dollar amounts of both the company's money and my own personal funds to marketable equities. Why would we do this if we didn't believe in the long-term potential for capital appreciation? The key is understanding that America has been a terrific country for investors who have the patience and discipline to stay the course.

Now, within capitalism, some businesses will flourish for a very long time while others turn into sinkholes. And I'll tell you something that might surprise you - it's actually harder than you'd think to predict which will be which. I've learned to be very skeptical of anyone who claims they can consistently pick the winners and losers. In my experience, those people are usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.

He warned: 'Never deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.' Now, many bankers thought they could 'manage' the rascal problem, and I've made the same mistake myself. Here's the fundamental challenge - people are not that easy to read. What makes it particularly tricky is that sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That's as true now as it was in McCulloch's time. While we always hope to work with able and trustworthy managers, making that judgment is one of the most difficult parts of what we do at Berkshire. I've learned through experience that you can't always prevent someone from cheating you by thinking you can outsmart them or put enough controls in place. The best approach is to focus on finding genuinely trustworthy partners from the start, but even then, we have to acknowledge that we'll sometimes get it wrong."

But what really sets us apart is our unusual constancy and clarity of purpose. We've got this wonderful group of long-time managers who view 65 as just another birthday and never think about leaving. That stability is invaluable. Now, while we certainly emphasize treating our employees, communities and suppliers well - and who wouldn't want to do that? - we maintain absolute clarity that our primary allegiance is to our country and our shareholders. We never forget that while your money is comingled with ours, it doesn't belong to us. That's fundamental to how we operate. This combination of slightly better businesses, exceptional managers, and crystal-clear purpose gives us an edge - not a huge one, mind you, but enough to do a bit better than average while taking less risk of permanent capital loss."

Instead of smoke signals, we now have instant worldwide communication that can facilitate global market paralysis in minutes. The participants haven't changed much - they're not more emotionally stable or better educated than when I was in school. In fact, I'd argue markets show more casino-like behavior now than ever before, and that casino has moved right into people's homes, tempting them daily. At Berkshire, we view these seizures differently - they're opportunities if you have both the capital and certainty of performance to act.

What's crucial is that we operate with minimal cash requirements and maintain a position in cash and Treasury bills far beyond what conventional wisdom suggests. During the 2008 panic, this approach proved its worth - we generated cash from operations and didn't need to rely on commercial paper, bank lines, or debt markets. We've structured Berkshire so we can handle financial disasters beyond anything we've seen before. We don't pay dividends, our share repurchases are completely discretionary, and we keep our annual debt maturities manageable.

If you make a couple of good decisions during your lifetime and - this is crucial - avoid serious mistakes, the rewards can be extraordinary. But notice I emphasize avoiding serious mistakes. Money can sometimes trump morality in the markets, but we've found that maintaining these core principles, staying within our circle of competence, and keeping a long-term perspective has served us remarkably well.

What we absolutely won't do is inflict permanent financial damage on our shareholders who've trusted us with their savings.

Look at AMEX - our share of their earnings in 2023 exceeded our entire original purchase cost of $1.3 billion. Both companies keep increasing their earnings and dividends year after year. Could I create better worldwide businesses than these? As Bertie would tell you: 'No way.' The lesson here is crystal clear - when you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Don't let the urge to 'do something' override the benefits of owning exceptional businesses for the very long term."

        "value": "Let me explain something that's obvious but often overlooked about share repurchases. When Berkshire buys back its own shares, even though we didn't directly purchase more Coke or AMEX shares in 2023, your indirect ownership in these companies - and every other asset Berkshire owns - actually increased. It's simple mathematics. But here's the critical caveat I always emphasize: all stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What's sensible at a discount to business value becomes downright stupid if done at a premium. This isn't complicated, but it's amazing how many companies ignore this basic principle. Think of it this way - in 2023, our shareholders benefited from increased ownership in wonderful businesses like Coke and AMEX through our repurchases, but we only made those repurchases when the price made sense. The key is to be disciplined about the price you pay. You can't just blindly buy back shares regardless of price and expect good results. It's like any other investment decision - price matters, and value should always be your guide."

        "value": "Well, railroads are incredibly capital-intensive businesses - they literally eat capital. Let me explain why. Take BNSF as an example. We're carrying about $70 billion of assets on our balance sheet - that's nearly 24,000 miles of track, almost 100 tunnels, over 13,000 bridges, and more than 7,500 locomotives. But here's the kicker - we have to spend more than our depreciation charge every single year just to maintain our current business level. Since we bought BNSF 14 years ago, we've spent $22 billion above and beyond GAAP depreciation charges. That's over $1.5 billion annually - ouch! This creates a real challenge because these expenditures reduce the dividends we can pay to Berkshire unless we want to increase debt, which we don't. So while we're getting an acceptable return on our purchase price, it's actually less than it might appear on paper, and it's truly a pittance when you consider the replacement value of these assets. That's just the reality of capital-intensive businesses, and particularly railroads. You can't avoid these ongoing capital needs - they're baked into the business model."

        "value": "Look, the simple fact is that America can't run without rail. While trucking wins for short hauls, many goods need to travel hundreds or thousands of miles to reach customers. That's where rail becomes indispensable. Now, let me give you some perspective on the scale we're talking about. BNSF is the largest of six major rail systems covering North America, and to replicate just our assets today - I'm talking about the tracks, tunnels, bridges, locomotives, and everything else - would cost at least $500 billion and take decades to complete. That's why we were able to buy BNSF in 2010 at what was really a small fraction of its replacement value. The market recognizes the capital-intensive nature of the business and prices these assets accordingly. But here's the key point - despite the enormous capital requirements, these assets are irreplaceable and essential to the country's functioning. You simply can't have a modern economy without a robust rail system. That's why we're willing to accept lower returns on replacement value - we understand we're buying into a vital piece of American infrastructure that will be needed for generations to come."

        "value": "Well, for over 100 years, we had what I'd call a very sensible arrangement in the utility business. The deal was pretty straightforward - utilities would get a fixed return on their equity, sometimes with a small bonus for doing an especially good job. This encouraged them to make the massive investments needed to keep the lights on, even years ahead of actual demand. It was a model that worked remarkably well. But now we're seeing this long-standing pact being broken in several states. In California, we've already seen their largest utility go bankrupt, and Hawaii is facing similar threats. This creates a real problem because utilities can't properly plan or finance those big, long-term projects they need to build. Take BHE's transmission project in the West - we started that in 2006, and it's still not finished. That's the nature of utility investments. When regulators start changing the rules of the game, it makes investors nervous, and rightfully so. You can't make 20-year investment decisions if you don't know if you'll be allowed to earn a reasonable return. The stability that made utilities such reliable investments for decades is being questioned, and that's a significant shift in what was once considered among America's most stable industries."

The traditional model of building above-ground transmission lines and conventional infrastructure is being challenged by climate change considerations. One of the big issues we're facing is the potential need for underground transmission lines. Now, think about this - a few decades ago, nobody wanted to even consider paying the staggering costs for putting all that infrastructure underground. But climate change is forcing us to look at these expensive alternatives. This creates a complex situation where we have to balance necessary infrastructure improvements with cost considerations. The 'margin of safety' approach that worked so well in the past - building extra capacity to handle unexpected growth - is becoming more complicated and expensive. At Berkshire, we're watching this carefully and making our best estimates about potential losses. But when you combine these infrastructure challenges with the regulatory uncertainty I mentioned earlier, you can see why investors are becoming increasingly apprehensive. We're dealing with investment decisions that will affect power delivery for decades to come, but the rules of the game and the technical requirements are shifting in ways that make long-term planning much more difficult."

Now, here's the key thing to understand - we don't yet know the final tally from BHE's forest-fire losses, and this uncertainty affects how we think about future investments in vulnerable western states. Look at what's happened with Pacific Gas and Electric and Hawaiian Electric - these are cautionary tales. While BHE and Berkshire are structured to weather negative surprises - and believe me, in the insurance business, we're quite familiar with those - we have to be prudent. I've always said we won't knowingly throw good money after bad. The regulatory environment is a critical factor here. If it becomes confiscatory, that's obviously negative for BHE, but we've built our operations to survive such challenges. That's the Berkshire way - prepare for the worst while hoping for the best."

What we're seeing is a potential fundamental shift in how utilities operate and are funded. The traditional model where utilities attract private savings from American citizens might not be sustainable for some companies. Instead, we could see more utilities forced to adopt what we call the public-power model. This isn't new - Nebraska made this choice back in the 1930s, and there are numerous public-power operations across the country today. The challenges are substantial: underground transmission costs are staggering, climate-related risks are increasing, and regulatory pressures are mounting. But ultimately, this isn't a decision that will be made in corporate boardrooms. The future model will be determined by voters, taxpayers, and users - they'll decide which approach they prefer. At Berkshire, we're positioned to adapt either way, but we're clear-eyed about the challenges facing the industry as a whole. Remember, we've built our business to survive negative surprises, but we also need to be realistic about the changing landscape."

The fascinating thing about good underwriters is that they can come in any package - thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But here's the critical point: they absolutely cannot be optimists when they're at work. Now, optimism is generally a wonderful quality in life, and I'm an optimist myself about America's future. But in the insurance business, optimism is dangerous. You see, surprises in property-casualty insurance almost always go in one direction - negative. And these surprises can show up decades after policies have expired. We've had our share of painful lessons about this at Berkshire. When you're estimating future loss payments, you need clear-eyed realists who understand that inflation - both the monetary kind and what we call 'legal' inflation - can be a real wild card. That's why we focus so intensely on having underwriters who maintain a healthy skepticism and conservative outlook when assessing risks."

And what's remarkable is that we still have substantial room to grow. But here's what makes P/C insurance both attractive and challenging: it's an industry where accounting requires us to make estimates about future losses, and those estimates can be hugely important. We've set records in sales, float, and underwriting profits, which is exceptional. But you have to be extremely careful. The business requires constant vigilance because when things go wrong - particularly when charlatans are involved - the problems can be both slow to surface and very costly to resolve. That's why at Berkshire, we put such emphasis on attempting to be accurate in our estimates of future loss payments. We've learned that success in this business comes from combining conservative underwriting with careful risk assessment and a long-term perspective."

Here's what happened: After being active financially for about 20 years - trading stocks, holding bonds, and having money in a mutual fund - she made a pivotal decision in 1980 at age 46. She simplified everything down to just two holdings: Berkshire and one mutual fund. Then - and this is the key part - she made no new trades for the next 43 years. That patience and simplicity led to tremendous wealth. The beautiful thing about Bertie's approach is that it didn't require any complex formulas or Wall Street wizardry. It was just common sense she picked up growing up in Omaha. Millions of American investors could have followed the same path. You see, in investing, activity is often the enemy of results. Bertie figured out that picking good investments and then showing extraordinary patience was the secret. She didn't need constant trading or fancy strategies. She just needed good judgment at the start and the discipline to stick with her choices. That's a lesson that's available to any investor - you don't need to be a genius, you just need common sense and patience."

Look at what happened: Berkshire moved to Omaha in 1970 after 81 years in New England, and then really flourished. Bertie spent her early years in a middle-class Omaha neighborhood and later became one of the country's great investors. Is it the water? The air? Is it some strange phenomenon like what makes Jamaica produce great sprinters or Kenya create marathon runners? I'm having some fun with this, of course, but there's something special about Omaha that seems to breed good business sense and investment acumen. We've seen it work its magic on Berkshire and on Bertie. That's why I invite everyone to come to Omaha in May for our annual meeting - to breathe the air, drink the water, and maybe absorb some of that Omaha common sense. While I'm being playful about the actual 'effect,' there's a serious point here about how the Midwestern values of common sense, patience, and straightforward thinking have contributed to both Berkshire's and Bertie's success. Sometimes the best business wisdom comes from the most unexpected places, and Omaha has certainly proved that point."
