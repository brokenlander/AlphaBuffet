The thing is, Mr. Market has some emotional problems, so his prices can be all over the place. Sometimes he's euphoric and thinks everything is great, and sometimes he's depressed and thinks everything is terrible. As an investor, it's essential to take a step back and not get caught up in Mr. Market's mood swings."

As for our corporate structure, we acknowledge it's not the most tax-efficient - operating as a partnership or 's' corporation would reduce our tax burden. However, our long-term investment strategy helps mitigate the penalty of our corporate form, and we'd follow this approach even if we were tax-exempt."

It's calculated by taking operating earnings, adding back non-cash charges like depreciation, and then subtracting the amount needed to reinvest in the business to keep it competitive. It's a more nuanced way to understand a company's real financial health."
