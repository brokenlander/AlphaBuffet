As an owner, I have to consider both the upside potential and the downside risk of a business project. But an option holder doesn't have that downside risk, so their interests can be quite different. For example, when it comes to dividend policy, an option holder would typically prefer a no-dividend policy, so they can benefit from the retained earnings. On the other hand, as an owner, I'd want a total payout so I can prevent the option holder from sharing in those earnings."

As I mentioned, our policy is to not comment on investments, even if speculation about them is untrue. It may not be what 'piggybackers' want to hear, but it's what's best for our owners - it helps keep the value of your Berkshire shares from being negatively impacted by unnecessary chatter."

Let me put it this way: if we paid for our $190 million in GEICO advertising with stock options instead of cash, would anyone seriously argue that we hadn't borne a cost for that advertising? Of course not. But under current accounting rules, that's essentially what happens when companies issue stock options - the cost is ignored. It just doesn't make sense."

To put that into perspective, the total earnings of the 500 companies on Fortune's list in 1997 were $324 billion. That's a staggering amount, and it suggests that the practice of taking large special charges is all too common in corporate America."
