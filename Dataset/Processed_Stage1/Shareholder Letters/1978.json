So, the numbers you see now are restated to reflect that merger, which makes them different from what we reported last year."

I'd say that was a marvelous period for us value-oriented equity buyers."

I'm not concerned if the market doesn't immediately recognize the value and revalue the securities upward. In fact, I prefer it if the market takes its time, because that gives me the opportunity to continue buying at attractive prices.
