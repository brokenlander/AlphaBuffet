By using cost, we get a smoother ride and a clearer view of how well we're really doing."

And let's be clear, the increase in earnings per share doesn't tell the whole story - we had more capital to work with in 1979, so our return on that capital was actually lower than in 1978."

We've since worked to build real value, and I think our results show that."

It just goes to show that external factors like inflation and currency stability can have a big impact on the value of your investment, no matter how well we manage the business internally."
