At Berkshire, we get excited about acquisitions too, but we prioritize economic substance over accounting appearance. I suspect many managers are driven by unspoken motivations, like the desire for increased activity and challenge, rather than purely economic considerations."

Investors think that by acquiring the company, they can improve its performance and make it more valuable than it would be if they just bought the shares on the market. But, as I like to say, you can always buy toads at the going price for toads - there's no need to pay a premium unless you think you can turn it into something more valuable."

But that won't last forever. And then there are the twin inflations - monetary and social. The latter refers to how courts and juries are increasingly interpreting policy coverage more broadly than insurers intended, which will drive up our costs. These factors will catch up with us, and when they do, our underwriting experience will get even worse."
