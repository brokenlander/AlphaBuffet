More importantly, some of our businesses have significant economic Goodwill that isn't fully reflected in our accounting Goodwill, which is carried on our balance sheet.

People are still willing to pay a premium for a box of See's chocolates, even if the price goes up. So, in current dollars, the value of that Goodwill increases. It's not that the Goodwill itself changes, but its value in terms of what people are willing to pay does. That's why I think true economic Goodwill will likely keep increasing in nominal value as inflation rises."

But, as I said, a business like See's is better equipped to handle that kind of scenario, and that's why we were willing to pay a premium for it."
