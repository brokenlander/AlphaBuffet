It's a tough spot to be in, but sometimes that's the only way to make a statement and potentially bring about change."

They can select outside directors who bring real value to the table, and those directors know their advice will be heard. Plus, the owner can make meritocratic decisions that benefit shareholders and correct any mistakes quickly. It's a much more efficient and effective way to run a company, in my opinion."
