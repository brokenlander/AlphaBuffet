This creates a lop-sided choice for management, where they can pay employees in options without having to count the cost, as opposed to paying them in cash and having to account for it. It's a pretty clear incentive for companies to opt for options over cash."

Let me put it this way: if we paid for our $190 million in GEICO advertising with stock options instead of cash, would anyone seriously argue that we hadn't borne a cost for that advertising? Of course not. But under current accounting rules, that's essentially what happens when companies issue stock options - the cost is ignored. It just doesn't make sense."

To put that into perspective, the total earnings of the 500 companies on Fortune's list in 1997 were $324 billion. That's a staggering amount, and it suggests that the practice of taking large special charges is all too common in corporate America."
