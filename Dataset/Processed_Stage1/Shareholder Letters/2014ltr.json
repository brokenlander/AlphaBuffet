            "content": "The decline in the purchasing power of the dollar is a crucial point for investors to understand. Essentially, it means that the money you have today won't buy as much as it would have in the past. Since 1965, the purchasing power of the dollar has dropped by 87%, which is staggering. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has risen dramatically over the same period. This disparity highlights the importance of investing in assets that can grow faster than inflation, like stocks. As I've said before, investing is about transferring purchasing power now in the hopes of getting more purchasing power later, after taxes. So, investors need to keep this in mind when making their decisions."

It's a lesson that's been proven over the past century, and I think it's one that investors should heed."
