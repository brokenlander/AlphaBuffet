Instead, his studies showed him that his preconceived notions were wrong, and that led him to think more deeply about how stocks should be evaluated."

It's a pretty simple concept, but it was a game-changer for investors."

When we first acquired the textile company in 1965, it used up nearly all of Berkshire's capital. But as we acquired more successful businesses, the textile operation's share of our capital dwindled to almost nothing by the early 1980s. It's a dramatic shift, and I'm glad we were able to move away from that struggling business and into more profitable areas."

Since we bought the company in 2012 for $221 million, its premium volume has grown by 379% to $1.9 billion in 2019, and it's delivered a satisfactory underwriting profit. I think a big part of its success is due to the leadership of Sy Foguel, who has done a fantastic job of expanding the company into new products and regions, and growing its float by 265%. Ajit Jain's instincts in buying GUARD were spot on, and it's a great example of how we can find hidden gems in unexpected places."
